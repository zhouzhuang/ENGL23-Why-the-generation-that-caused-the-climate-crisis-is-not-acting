The lecture video, “Why the generation that caused climate change is not acting” gives a reasonable explanation as to why a lot of older people do not believe that climate change is a pressing issue. What’s most heartbreaking to me is how selfish we are as a country. The poorest countries who would much rather have our lifestyle have done nothing to contribute to this climate crisis, yet, they are the ones who will suffer the most. This doesn’t surprise me. Ken is right. Most of the elected officials in congress are part of the generation that has contributed the most to climate change. They are used to living this selfish, carefree lifestyle and benefiting from the fossil fuel industries. 
<br><br>
The explanations that the climate change deniers believe in are extraordinarily absurd. I think its hypocritical that they think scientists are trying to trick the public and elected officials into believing in climate change because they are corrupt when the officials in office are the most corrupt and benefit the most from big corporations. The older generation has done enough damage to future generations as it is, but now the more serious problem at hand is climate delay. We can’t delay acting on these consequences any longer. Unfortunately, it’s the duty of my generation to figure out what to do about this before we reach even greater peril. This video provides implications for my generation to do something about the current elected government officials. It is our duty to vote no matter how much voting power the older generation has because it’s better to keep fighting than to give up without doing anything about it in the first place.

It is still incomprehensible that so many people outright deny climate change. With all of the data, tangible evidence and explanations given by scientists, there is really no reason to not believe in human caused climate change. While I do not understand why they deny it, I understand some people's opinion that the issue is not as important to them personally at this point in time. As Ken stated, many people rank healthcare, economy, and social security as more of a factor when choosing a political leader. This relates to Maslow's Hierarchy of needs, which states people need their basics before they can start to care about the bigger picture. Many people of the generation at fault are active in trying to fix the problem, but likely believe it is up to the next generation (us) to actually fix it. Politicians are generally older, and their main focus is either money or staying in power. This causes some of them to deny climate change to please their demographic, which furthers the problem of them not acting on the issue. This ideology is flawed, but it is the reality, and we have to work with what we've got.


<br><hr>
I agree with you and with Ken’s point in this video. Everyone should be contributing something (whether it be a change in lifestyle or a new political policy such as the New Green Deal) in fighting the battle of the climate crisis. However, the older generation especially Ken’s age group have “better things” to worry about like healthcare for when they retire or their own comfort in life which paints them as “hypocrites” to people of our age group (Gen Z’s) who suffer with trying to “fix” or reverse the issue. I also think that it’s so bizarre that people would contradict scientific research with conspiracy when our own American government is known for being suspicious of conspiracy. The science is there! The proof is all around us and yet there are so many people and politicians like Marco Rubio who choose to not acknowledge it when the state of Florida will be a victim to flooding from rising sea levels. Even if it is unfortunate I agree, it is us who have to act upon this issue because we cannot afford to slack off globally and wait for change. Our peers have already started with movements such as the Sunrise Movement and activists like Greta Thunberg while making sacrifices such as academics to picket and draw attention to the issue.


<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. Older generation could not realize how damaged our environment is. Instead our generation are trying our best to save it
<br><hr>
There is a lot in this comment that I agree with. First of all, is your statement of the selfishness of our country. I could talk about all the problems we have created for days on end, but it still does not measure up to the damages that these problems are causing and will continue to cause for many years. The people in this world that live a largely lavish lifestyle are the ones most dependent on fossil fuels, but also the ones causing the problems in the first place. As if this was not already frustrating enough, those in other parts of the world contributing way less to the climate crisis are already feeling its effects. 

<br><br>
That problem aside, the other aspect of you comment that I connected with was the increasingly politicized aspect of the climate crisis. On a subject that has literally been proven by science, people are still in denial due to political propaganda. Of course a politician that is being back by a big corporation making profits off of fossil fuel use will deny its reality, they are being paid to do it. This in itself if proof of corruption, but the fact that it is the older generations that are causing this delay is worse. They are not only delaying action, but straight up trying to negate it because the climate crisis is not something that they believe will affect themselves. All I have to say about that is that I am mad.
<br><hr>
I feel that everything you wrote in your comment was very thought provoking and impactful, however one of the statements which really caught my attention was when you spoke about how older people in politics are "used to living this selfish, carefree lifestyle and benefiting from the fossil fuel industries". This was so eye catching to me because I often wonder why people in politics tend to ignore the warnings of climate scientists and have so little care for the environment, would it really be so terrible to do something that helps our planet for once? Then I realize, as you stated, that most of these politicians are just in it for the money, and that the money is coming from the fossil fuel industry. Many climate change deniers feel the way they do because they fear that a political shift that focuses on climate change will be detrimental to our democracy. Although, they don't seem to consider politicians being controlled like puppets by big oil companies to be harmful to our democracy, so what's the big deal then?  
<br><br>
It is becoming increasingly obvious, as this video and your comment indicate, that the older generation that caused this issue isn't planning on doing anything to finish what they started (ie. the climate crisis) anytime soon. As you stated, it is more important now than ever to get out there and vote. It is no longer a luxury we can afford to throw away, as you said it is "our duty", and one we need to prioritize before anything else.
<br><hr>
Those who contributed the most to the climate crisis remain in office doing nothing about the issue. I wonder what will happen when our generation takes over office. Will it be too late to change the oncoming dangers? Will we feel motivated to take action, or just sit aside while we wait for impending doom on the generations after us? It's selfish of the generations before us to allow the climate crisis to build while forcing responsibility onto my generation. This is, in my opinion, an act of inter-generational injustice. We have a responsibility to take care of the generations following ours. This responsibility derives from not only human decency, but also from the want to preserve humans. We shouldn't set each following generation up for increasing failure because that will inevitable result in extinction of the human race.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment completely. I think that it is completely absurd that the people who are having the greatest detrimental effects on the climate are very often the deniers themselves. This is painful to look at the developing communities, animals, and children, whose lives have been changed forever with no action of themselves. I also really resonated with your point on the absurdity of the explanations the climate deniers back their cause with. It truly makes me lose some of my faith in humanity when there are people making elaborate tales of secrecy and lies instead of accepting facts and facing the damage that is being done. To me, these people are deeply irrational that they will go out of their way, create and live by these absurd explanations of why the climate crisis is a hoax instead of using this time and effort to take action for the betterment of our world. 
<br><br>
I also think your point at the end about the weight of responsibility put on our generation is very important. The truth is, this burden is terrifying and the fact that is falling on our shoulders is a lot for any young person to realize. However, the worst thing we can do is let this burden overwhelm and stop us. We must let it fuel us. We can be told our vote will not make a difference as it is just a drop in the bucket, but when all those drops collect, you have an impact that can’t be ignored.
<br><hr>
You noted that climate change deniers say scientists are attempting to fool the public with their studies and how it is hypocritical. I feel it is also extremely ironic. The scientists are being suppressed by fossil fuel companies who hire their own scientists to conduct rigged studies on how the climate is not changing. I mean can it get worse, they are calling the truthful ones liars, and then turn around a believe the true lairs. This reveals a whole dark side to American democracy. Yes it is the land of the free, but how can anything get done when there is so much bickering and so many special interests. I mean the Chairman for the Senate Committee on Environment and public works. John Barrasso has names such as Chevron and Exxon Mobile on his list of contributors. Would this man be inclined to pass groundbreaking environmental legislation, or would he just let it die in committee. I think we all know the answer. This, I believe just adds to the point that Professor Hiltner was saying in his lectures. The people in power right now are not and will not make the change, it is down to us to get them out of office and get new people in their places.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you said and I think it also goes back to the fact that back then there were not that many regulations, so they would go on and do whatever they thought would get companies the most profit. Thus they committed the most damage to the planet. Similarly, it's upsetting that the countries that have made the most damage are not the ones that suffer the most, instead the poorest countries have to manage how to survive to all the repercussions of climate change. And like you said, we being the wealthy and developed country, are still heavily relying on fossil fuels instead of implementing the use of renewable resources. We are the future of this planet and it is our duty to use all of our resources to make a change and try our best to ensure we have a inhabitable planet for us and future generations.
<br><hr>
I agree with your viewpoints on government officials being hypocritical and corrupt. The older generation did not care for the climate crisis and as a result we are now experiencing more natural disasters and catastrophes. The generations before us emitted tons of greenhouse gases because they are more profitable to use, but this drastically increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Because of peoples selfishness, we are in the biggest climate crisis of all time. If anything is going to be done about this it is up to our generation to act and make positive changes contributing to the cause. We need to make sure that to vote in elected officials that care about the climate crisis. We need to bring more awareness to the climate crisis and act as soon as possible to prevent further disasters. If we continue to watch the effects without taking action, are Earth will quickly fall apart.
<br><hr>
It is truly saddening to see how people only have self interest in mind when making decisions. Financial gain is far more important to people than a communal respect for our planet. This is a cultural issues that people have learned to do and accept. Climate change deniers are simply searching for an answer that will give them comfort in themselves. Rather than looking at the facts, they are searching for any excuse to justify their selfish and harmful actions. People do not want to admit that they are responsible for destroying a planet, so they find ways to convince themselves they are not. 

<br><br>

Because of  generation of people are in denial of their affects on the planet and are unwilling to make changes, the pressure is put on our generation to try to search for a fix to a dying planet. It is our duty to elect officials that will protect our planet, and on top of that take personal action to act in a more environmentally friendly way. Buying into the proceeding generations lifestyle choices and denials of climate change are a surefire way to increasing the speed of our planets destruction exponentially.
<br><hr>
The most frustrating part is the overwhelming evidence that there is human caused climate change. It is absolutely outrageous that the younger generation is trying to convince majority of Ken’s generation of the damage they have caused. Knowing our current politicians will do nothing to help convince this generation and continue to support oil companies is the worst part. We will never get anywhere with our current political system, and that is why it is so important for this generation to vote and put the right leaders in office that will make a difference.
<br><hr>

I'd agree with you that it is incredibly important for us to vote to try and change the power structures that have put us in this situation. It is hardhowever to get passed the feelings o four votes not mattering and our ideas not being fully represented in our government. Even though I know how important my votes can be, im not entirely convinced they they will matter. This is partly because the structure of of our government runs so parallel with the interests of our capitalist economy and long held beliefs of American exceptionalism. It worries me that people our agecan have entirely different views about these issues than us because climate change is so counteractive to their social identity. I imagine the case of a child of coal miners who have experienced decades of family history and culture that have been en-grained into who they are. I would be mad and skeptical too if someone told me that my whole livelihood was ruining the world. It is very difficult to get around this and at some point we have to figure out what narratives best get through to people.

<br><hr>
This lecture video does give a reasonable explantation as to why the older generation does not believe climate change is as serious as it is. Honestly, I don't really care what they think or how much they apologize. The cost that they have caused on the climate is already sunk. They put out 3/4 of carbon emissions, and that's not something that you can take back. What's important is that we act on it; complaining about what could've been is taking away energy and time for what can be. Nevertheless, the apologies are sincere and are appreciated. But, now it's time for us to all work together toward a common cause. I also agree that the poorest countries are the ones who will suffer the most, and that's unfair. They want what we have, and we hate what we have at times. Everything seems to be taken for granted, but maybe that's just how the older generation taught us to be. The older generation is the one in power, I agree. They hold the positions of authority and power to change all of this, but that does not mean that we don't have power either. We vote those people in, and millions of voices can sway the course of a handful of powerful people if executed in the right way. Much like the article read this week, we have to stray away from the idea of "moral laziness" to make a change so that our voices can be heard.

<br><hr>
Your point is very similar to mine. Our nation is a major "contributor" to the climate crisis. In the last century, the United States emitted greenhouse gases for developing. At the same time, many other countries did not start their industries that early. They started late, but when they are starting now, the world is already polluted and ruined by our developments. It is our responsibility for the earth, to clean it. Since the climate change is so bad now, many countries are not able to do large developments, and this is not fair. Ken's generation should act right now to counteract the negative changes. They should sign more bills to pass laws against the climate changes.
<br><br>

Everyone needs to know the climate crisis, more related education should be given to the older generations. The other idea is that the way of analyzing the greenhouse gas emissions is wrong. Since, different countries have different populations. Therefore, the unit for organizing the emission should not be per country, but per person.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with that the argument climate change deniers make no sense what so ever.  The elected officials don't even care about the people they are supposed to make policies for so they can lead and live better lives.  Instead, all they care about is the money that the companies that use fossil fuels to make billions put into their pockets.    The older generation has hurt all generations that will come after them because of all the CO2 they put into the air and they STILL continue to make it worse.  The Climate Crisis ranked 18/29 !!!! for the Baby Boomers in the US which is unreal to me.  The fact is that people will believe what they want to believe.  Those that are older won't have to see the consequences that they have put on our planet they will on reap the benefits of continual CO2 use.  You are 100% right it is now up to us to change the world for the better by putting better people into office that will make changes.  We cannot rely on the older generation at all so it is on us and our children to make this world livable for the foreseeable future

<br><hr>
I agree that it is of imperative for our generation to do as much as we can to promote climate and environmental policies that will aid our future and our future generations, however I think that the system, particularly here in the United States, that we are working within is inherently flawed. Ken talks about how even the youth movements of the 60s never really gained power but rather influenced those in power. I think the scale of the climate crisis is one that demands a youth decision-making power, rather than just an influential one. Doing what we have always done – waiting for the old and stubborn to die – isn’t going to cut it based on time alone. I personally struggle to think about how we can work to address the climate crisis from a standpoint of responsibility, within our inherently flawed democratic system.
<br><hr>
It is sad that other parts of the world are affected by us. But like you said, people just care about a carefree lifestyle and do not care about how it affects other people. Also, I agree that we should act now. It is our job to fix the earth for what our old generations have done to it. The only problem is are we able to fix this or are we just going to be lazy and follow the footsteps of our old generation.
<br><hr>

Yes, for sure, the worse part is not how climate crisis influences the world currently but is that people still no awareness of the danger of climate crisis. People always like to use their past personal experience to judge an event, which is wrong in the statistic. Even the big data, in this fast-changing period, can be wrong badly. This is a new period, the technology makes an unprecedented convenience for people and also produces unprecedented results. 
<br><br>


The nearsightedness of people also causes the misbehavior of the politician, who will use the one side perspective to cater and mislead the people in order to get votes. All the scientific problem has different perspectives, only use one of it can really mislead the audience. This negative circle, one negative result causes another negative result and they will strengthen each other. Moreover, there are more than two-thirds people only get the negligible benefits but need to suffer the same negative result.
<br><hr>
I agree with what you said. It is true that the people who live in the more developed countries are having less care about the consumption of both the environment and global warming. On the contrary side, the people who were working for the developed countries have to pay the responsibility to take care of the pollution that control by the developed countries' people.
<br><br>
There is a vivid example that just happened in my country. As a Chinese, which is a big developing country that created a lot of stuff every day. Are producing a lot of products that create a lot of CO2 every day. But the cost of the products is cheap. The productivity of Chinese labor is cheap. On the contrary side, those developed countries who asked Chinese labor did not take the responsibility of air pollution and the soil pollution that will happen in China. They just take the products and pay the labor money for China. However, the Chinese people have to breathe in the CO2 or any other harmful air which causes thousand of Chinese people having lung diseases.
<br><br>
Consequently, I recommend having either more tax on those developed countries on asking developing countries to produce stuff or just creating anything in their own countries.
<br><hr>
I don’t really think there are many actual climate change deniers in congress in the sense that I don’t think they believe climate change is a hoax. I think they understand what climate change is and the threat it poses, but they simply do not care because lobbyists are lining their pockets and the threat is ‘not imminent’ since they most likely won’t be directly affected by it. The people who will suffer the most are the poorest in countries they probably have never heard of, so it’s irrelevant to them. They just call themselves climate change deniers to justify their decisions and to acquire votes from conservatives and more extreme right-wing voters. Maybe this sounds like a conspiracy theory but it honestly doesn’t seem too far fetched in my opinion.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with your argument. I believe we can no longer deny the facts that there is a very real and very urgent climate crisis. The older generations have screwed us over but it has now become our responsibility to fix it. And while the task at hand is tedious and difficult the only way we are going to have a chance at fixing it, is if we open our eyes now. The statistics and proof are all there, it is up to us to decide if we want to vote and actually change our actions. We must stop blaming the poorer countries for mistakes that we have made.
<br><hr>
I think it’s easy for people of the generation that are responsible for climate change (or at least those who acknowledge that climate change is in fact a problem)  to say that climate change was a necessary evil that can be balanced out by the economic growth, prosperity and technological developments that we benefit from now. However, knowing that even scientists in the 1960s tried to warn the people about the potential consequences of their actions but were ignored renders that  excuse invalid in my books. Basically, they took the easy way out but there is always another way. Of course, the priority now is how to address the changes that need to be made moving forward. However, I think that the past mistakes must be acknowledged because the leaders of that generation should feel a sense of remorse and responsibility for what they have caused. After all, the first to suffer from their decisions are often those who have never benefited from their decisions either. I think if there was more of a sense of accountability, then things would be different today. Especially since those who caused the problem are mostly still those in power today. I suppose it’s up to us then, to take up the mantle and do what the generation before us cannot. It wouldn’t be the first time that a generation had to address a preceding generation’s crucial mistakes. I look forward to when this course will start more thoroughly addressing what we can do instead of focusing on the errors that have been made and the devastating results (though I believe that what we’re covering now is important to because ignorance on this issue is perhaps the first thing that should be addressed!)
<br><hr>
Older generations are not showing any initiative to do something impactful to reverse the effects of the climate crisis. With all the information that is available about the climate crisis, it is shocking that there are still people who try to downplay the very serious effects of this. Climate change deniers are those who are still in positions of power and who shape the way our society relies on these fossil fuels. The profit that comes from the exploitation and destruction of the environment far outweighs the need to acknowledge how much damage these industries are actually creating. For example, Exxon knew about the melting of the arctic ice cap 40 years ago and instead of publishing that information, they looked for the best way to make a profit off of that. Exxon continues to profit off the destruction of the planet and they continue to support politicians who will protect their interests.
<br><hr>
I agree with you. Climate delay is a big problem, and as we keep on being complacent as a country, the window of time for us to step in will keep decreasing. I've lived all of my life in the US, and I feel as though I have held a sense of pride for living in a nice country. Now I start to wonder why the US isn't taking bigger action against climate change when we are in such a leadership position amongst other countries. The US is extremely developed, having access to plenty of resources that would be helpful in the fight against climate change, yet we still stay, for the most part, inactive. It seems the US is too preoccupied with other issues, partly because, at first glance, climate change doesn't seem to be a big issue for most people. This can be partly due to how its effects are gradual and somewhat invisible. This allows people to not worry about it and focus on more immediate concerns instead.
<br><hr>
Many people simply prioritize their own interests over the interests other people. I have experienced this in daily life an annoying number of times, the system of people to whom one is concerned about is to individual themselves. We want to maximize this single occupant system rather than to expand the system to include those young and old around us and consider the net gains or losses of this whole system. It is clear in the elderly voting history where their concerns lie, on their own lives. It is certainly difficult to blame them, but unfortunately, we must make this choice and it is necessary for the future of complex life to prioritize issues that effect a larger scope of people.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. The reasons for late and never started action are analyzed and completely explained by Ken in “Why the generation that caused climate change is not acting.” Time delay, together with a state of deep denial, is the fundamental reason for no action. Those people who have a big impact on society and those who play significant roles in government and corporations take small care of the climate crisis; even though climate crisis is increasingly recognized as real, it’s not a priority for many people, especially people of Ken’s generation. These people stay away from the issue and stay silent because there were no serious consequences and problems by the time they released CO2. This is actually the mind of a fluke. Just like students who didn’t prepare for exams yet still get a good score, the mind of a fluke will tolerant them do it for the second time and the third… However, this kind of fluke mind should not be tolerant at all, from now on. The horrible numbers and data give us no time to accidentally make “mistakes” over and over again. We should all act right now.
<br><hr>
I also believe that it is heartbreaking how the poorest countries in the world will suffer the most as a result of our actions as a nation. We need to take responsibility for our actions as our lavish lifestyle will literally cause our death. I also agree that the climate time delay is one of our main issues right now. It is easy to stay ignorant and continue on with our current lifestyle when we do not immediately witness the consequences of our actions.
<br><br>

It discourages me a little to know that the elected people in Congress are those who mostly do not believe that climate change is a big issue. Although climate change affects everyone and should not be a political issue, it is easier to make changes when you have the power to do so, especially at a national level. Therefore, I also believe that it is important to vote because it gives us a voice in what we want in the nation and who we want to represent us. If we keep on voting and expressing our discontent with the current trajectory of our nation regarding climate change, we will make a difference.
<br><hr>
I agree with your opinion about Ken’s idea. From my personal perspective, Older generations do have less concern about climate change. Some of them are still the climate change denier. I have read an article accidentally. It described that in the early period, when scientists report that climate change is rising and we need to prevent it, most politicians chose not to believe it and told the public that there was no climate change. So I guess some of the older generations might be influenced by this opinion. What makes me the most disappointing is the existing environmental crisis is actually caused by these generations. I feel thankful for their contribution to the development of our society, but during the process, they bought much damage to our earth, such as the ocean trash. Some of them are still denying that the actions taken by them have a bad influence on the environment. It is hard to change their attitude and ideas. But it is not that pessimistic, because we, the new generations, have a realization about climate change already. In the future, we can do our best to protect the earth.
<br><hr>
I agree with your words, just as I agree with Ken's video. It is reasonable indeed that the older generation is less concerned with the idea of climate crisis, which is also unacceptable because of how selfish it is. The people who are in power right now, are truly the ones who put those carbon dioxides into our atmosphere. They caused the problems, so they don't want to admit it anyway, since it's not likely that the climate crisis will bring severe consequences to them. However, as Ken mentioned in the lecture, it's sad that the three groups that will largely be affected are not the older generation. Those people in less developed countries accounted almost nothing to our greenhouse gases emissions but took the worst consequences. Those other species did nothing but got their lives threatened because of what we did. And last but not least, the generation after them, even the ones yet to come, have to clean up what was done by the previous generations. I personally think this is a good point where we can try to get those old politicians to act against the climate crisis. Most of us have or will have kids, even if we don't care about the living condition of ourselves, we should however, think about our kids. We should consider the continuation of our heritage and save a clean Earth for them.

<br><hr>
I believe we don't have to wait until our generation takes over governmental offices to be able to stop the consequences of our predecessors irresponsibility. Today, in our own unique lives, we can start doing our part in reducing our contribution to this crisis. I think it's very interesting how we tend to wait for authorities to lead us to do something or wait until someone who share our ideologies come in power, before we take action on things we care about. All you need is yourself. The motivation you need to do something meaningful is already in you. I think emphasizing that taking care of the planet is an act of human decency is key. We are in a pop culture, trend-setting generation. We can raise millions by creating trendy challenges like the ALS bucket challenge because we cared enough about that issue and we made it an appealing process. For sure, we can start with building a radical change within ourselves. Using public transportation frequently can be a cool thing if we make it seem like it its. We can create enough clout and hype around it that the process can seem trendy but preserving our planet at the same time. My point is, we are really capable, we are so smart and talented and creative- enough to destroy our planet, I'm pretty sure we can create something that can create something to build  a culture of preserving the planet, but we have to start with ourselves.
<br><hr>
I agree with strongly.The only reason why an issue cannot be solved is because people didn’t take it seriously. For the old generation who see this as a nature cycle, this is just ridiculous. As what the professor says, if you smoke but the symptoms didn’t appear on you, so you think smoking is harmless, but when it finally acts on your next generation, it is already too late to take it back. A data in the video can prove my point of view. A data shows that actually 70% of people believe in that climate changes are caused by humans, but why the environment isn’t getting better then? It is because people realize there is a problem indeed, but only a part of them concern it enough, the rest of them don’t act until the issue becomes urgent enough.

The climate crisis is a global issue that should be addressed more frequently, as we should, as a whole, try to come up with solutions to slow it down and stop it from getting worse. Instead, we have climate change deniers who have idiotic responses and explanations to studies that scientists have dedicated their whole lives to. Unfortunately, these climate change deniers are going after teachers and ignorant groups of people and are often persuading such people that climate change is unreal or not caused by humans. This is very scary to think about, for teachers and the older generations are the ones who are raising the newer generations and teaching them that climate change is a hoax. 

<br><br>
It’s very heartbreaking and unfair knowing that those living in poverty- who have nothing to do with the climate crisis- are the ones who will suffer the most. Many impoverished countries, such as Thailand and India, are facing severe consequences due to first world countries' actions and lifestyles. We were the ones who created a worldwide issue, so we are the ones who should own up and take responsibility for our actions.

Both of the videos you made brought together the past and present to hopefully save the future. The faults of those before us and even before Ken does hurt us now. Older people can be less reactive now due to the fact that they feel like their lives are ending anyways, but in their youth, I feel like since there wasn't an immediate threat occurring or thousands dying right in their communities they felt the need to be passive about it. The economy being more of a worry isn't that surprising since money always has been placed above the people, look at the cigarette industry back then or how fast fashion functions now. People in my generation or the next can do their best by educating themselves and each other, doing more research and making some lifestyle changes. Nothing super abrupt if it seems unreasonable, but baby steps and effort do count towards something. The future doesn't have to seem so dark and like the world is ending, there can be hope for redemption it's just that change needs to occur now.

Ken states that the reason why the generation who caused the climate crisis did not make any action is because they deny it. Rather than the denial, I think human these days simply are aware of the climate crisis, but they just don’t realized its serious consequences.Because of the climate delay,the bad consequences has not been completely turned out. The generation and the next generation is not yet alert but they really need to act now to prevent further catastrophe happen.

It is obvious as to why these climate change deniers are so transfixed on undermining the gravity of the environmental crisis that we have been facing over the years. These politicians and elected officials who disavow the reality of climate change are the same ones who benefit and receive donations from the big businesses and corporations. Furthermore, the ones in power and unfortunately from the same generation who once ignored and denied climate change, so if they rebutted it then, then why should we expect change now? Additionally, the people who these deniers have grasped will now only adhere to their agenda and automatically reject anything that climate scientists say that promote the reality of climate change, due to their confirmation bias. They will label it as "alarmist" or "fake news" because even though the politicians might deny it, at the end of the day they most likely know the truth, whereas the masses may not, especially those who are lacking in education. The most saddening part is how little our country cares about other parts of the world, and only helps other nations when we can benefit off of it. Underdeveloped countries suffer the most from climate change, yet they contribute the least to it. This selfish nature of our country for the sake of our own luxury is nothing short of cruel. This lecture video offers great insight as to the reasons these older generations refuse to believe climate change, let alone mitigate the effects of it. Now it is being forced upon this generation. But, I do believe that our generation has the education and willingness to try and resolve this global issue.

This lecture video explains very well how and why the climate crisis is a generational issue. It is sad that the poorest half of humanity have nothing  to do with the climate crisis but they will suffer the most severe consequences. It is also wild that people did not believe scientists in the past. We are all responsible for this and are still denying the fact even though scientists have been trying to alert people even before Ken's lifetime. When i hear the argument of deniers that Ken gives an example of, it really makes my blood boil. Also, we are making animals suffer who do nothing but live freely and contribute nothing to the climate crisis. The next generation is going to most likely have to forget about living a regular life and fight off the climate crisis once it widely impacts EVERYONE. They will be waking up every morning concerned about their lives instead.

This country is run on fossil fuel energy. SInce the 80s, the media has inflicted damage onto the masses spreading propaganda. It is time that we tell everyone what the media is up to. Fossil fuel companies pay major news networks to portray climate change as an issue that is debatable. It is not debatable, this is a real crisis affecting everyone. I hope everyone knows that someday. Ken also brought up a great point about our politicians. 
<br><br>

Most politicians come from the generation that started climate change. They do not seem to care. Look at Nancy Pelosi. She is the Speaker of the House and has not fought hard enough to fight climate change. In my opinion, that's worse than the Republicans. The Republicans will just deny that climate change is happening. Pelosi is one of the top leaders of the Democrat Party and she acknowledges that climate change is happening. She is just delaying or doing incremental steps towards fighting climate change. People do not have 80 years to wait.

What can we do to cut carbon emissions to 80-90 percent of what they are today? This is the question asked in this lecture video “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting”. The answer to this question is complicated but simple at the same time. In simple terms the answer to our question is that we must completely revolutionize the norms which we hold true to our life in an incredibly industrialized world. But the task of carrying out this revolution will be very complicated. Just a few of the things we will have to change in our everyday lives seem like simple things, but, when every American in this country participates in such activities on a daily basis, the effects on our environment are detrimental. This is due to the fact that parents buy individually wrapped fruit snacks for their children’s school lunches, or even worse just swing by McDonald’s for a happy meal after school. Although these conveniences may not seem like luxuries, they are. And they are luxuries we need to wrap our brains around ditching very soon. Do we realize how much carbon emissions go into making mini plastic bags of fruit snacks, when the waste-free and healthy option could be an apple. An apple which grows on trees, which reduce carbon in our air, and has no footprint (in trash) left over to be thrown into the landfill, or more likely in Santa Barbara county, finding its way into the ocean.

After watching the lecture video "Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting", I feel very unbelievable with the denial  to climate change from this generation. From the data rank, the climate change is in  18th  in  most important thing to them. They just care about the social security, economy and terrorism. The morst ironic thing is that the most power is controlling by this generation, so there is no effective action to deal with the climate changing. However , I think it is caused by no enough knowledge and science understanding. With the development of technology, I think most parts of people can have a access to the Internet, next generation can judge how they need to deal with climate changing because of its ugency. We should act soon avoiding famine, wars, and pains to next generations.

<p>
I agree that one of the direct causes of climate change is our greed and complete disregard for others with the obvious consequences of our actions. Additionally, I think that what makes it difficult for people of that generation is the fact that they have become accustomed to a certain lifestyle and would rather be able to maintain it at the expense of others instead of making vital changes to their way of life. What's worse, this ideology of overconsumption and greed has and is being passed down to each generation which perpetuates this problem. Climate denial and climate delay go hand in hand because they both lack a strict course of action to combat our consumer lifestyle. Talking about the issue is important, yes, but without proper and clear steps to take, nothing is going to get done. 

<br><br>
It is so important to focus our attention on those in power because they are the ones who have the say in what we do as a country to either ignore or combat this issue. Of course people are going to be swayed towards denying and delaying action against the climate crisis because it's more glamorous and easy to live our comfortable life as we have for decades rather than give up our privileges. How we can ensure that changes will be made on the federal level and in our infrastructure is widespread knowledge about each individual's impact and removing those who deny this problem from positions of power. We need to develop a more humanitarian attitude where we stop making our own selfish desires the center of our lives.

I did not think about why previous generation does not make some efforts to help our planet. The results of climate change delayed. Previous generation cannot experience the severe consequences pf climate change. Although, the temperature has increased around 2 degrees, we did not feel a lot different. Because lots of catastrophes about climate change happened along the shoreline or some islands. So some people deny the climate change since they did not feel something about it. But we should pay attention to this climate change, the rate of increasing temperature is increasing. According to the cop21, we need to control the temperature do not increase more than 1.5 degrees, but now it has increased 2/3. we must make some efforts. Our generation should take control of the planet to make it better.

This lecture finally made me understand why people, especially the previous generation, clearly knew the harm of climate change but still failed to do anything. One side is the benefits that the oil industry can bring to them, and the other side is the"climate change" existing mostly as a notion in their mind, sadly, almost every politicians will make the same choice: abandoning our planet. Of course, they will ignore the harm brought by climate change. First of all, most of the politicians are people of the older generation. They are in high places, and their lives won’t be easily bothered by the change of external environment. As long as their life conveniences are not affected, they will always insist climate change is nothing but an exaggerated rumor that causes unnecessary panic. Secondly, based on the time delay theory, even though the older generation and the developed countries are aware of the severe results come after all the damages caused by nowadays human behaviors, they would still change nothing because the younger generations, us, and the poorest people in the world will take those consequences for them. Therefore, It is really important for us, the current generation, to make a step by either taking part of elections or doing eco-friendly stuffs.

I find it really interesting how much the older generations deny that the climate crisis is a pressing issue. Although in a roundabout way, it 
makes sense. They don't see the effects of climate change, and they're not going to live long enough to see a vast difference therefor they 
don't care as much. This is extremely selfish behavior on their part. Although Americans take this route a lot, all generations of Americans.
 <br><br>
 If they can't see the problem or if the problem is far enough from their daily lives it doesn't matter. Whereas climate change is affecting countries 
that had little to no part in climate change because of its more pronounced over there climate change isn't a pressing matter to most Americans.

The denial of climate change is really an interesting topic to pick at. Many of those denying our planet's demise often accredit the climate change, or "global warming" to the natural phenomena that has caused the change of the planet predating our species. Or, even that there is a "deep state" motive to destroy democracy through the means of total government control as a result of falsifying a climate crisis. The former argument, though, fails to account for data showing how fast we are increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. It's alarming, because even if it was natural, we are still bound to extinction. The Permian-Triassic extinction event, 252 million years ago, caused mass extinction when the carbon dioxide levels rose to 2000 ppm. Though the cause is debated upon, it is agreed that it was natural (seeing that an impact event is "natural") and this is the route we are taking. We must take action to reduce our carbon outputs and begin reversing our destruction of our planet.

The lecture video, “Why the generation that caused climate change is not acting", gives us a reason how did the old generation causes the climate crisis and the reason why they are not acting. I think this is because human is mean. The old generation is the beneficiary of climate critics. They enjoy the benefit that brings from using the powers and population.  But they don't have to suffer from the consequences. If people keep getting the benefits from one thing, and they don't have to face the consequences, as only the poor are suffering from the consequences brought from the climate crisis, at all, no one will stop doing this. Therefore, we can see why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not action. Also, I believe for the old generation, they don't believe there is a climate crisis, they think that is fake. They don't believe that theory.



</p><hr>


<p>
I go along with the idea that the poor suffer from the climate crisis most while the rich contribute to climate crisis most. It’s the deplorable and pitiful truth, while there are economic causes behind this phenomenon. Many of developed countries have fossil-fuel based economy, which means they benefit from fossil fuel while they discharge a large amount of harmful gas that leads to climate crisis.
<br><br>
What’s more, theories denying the climate crisis prevent our generation acting in improve climate crisis. However, whether we choose to believe in the existence of climate crisis or not, we are going to live through it anyway. We can’t ignore it like our elders. Just like Ken said, climate denial and climate delay can only result in nothing and inaction. On the other hand, they can cause our generation and even our next generation to continue suffering from severe climate crisis. Hence, it’s urge for us to take actions to prevent further climate crisis.

This video presented a lot of statistics that I didn't know and didn't think was relevant till now I guess. In the more developed world, I think that baby boomer generation, people in their 70s, 40s/50s all have their priorities somewhere else because the times were different. Maybe, during their life time they encountered different issues that we didn't (because they solved it), and that's why they care about issues such as medicare for all or gun control. I think that because all of these issues are interconnected, if we can help the poor rise, give them resources, then they will have the time to care about the climate. Maybe I am just romanticizing people in general but I think that because for millennials, the most pressing issue in the present is climate change, so that becomes our priority. The millennials didn'thave to worry about immigration, putting food on the table, not getting deported, etc, but they have to worry about the world ending because it is now happening more explicitly. I do feel that the older generation could be more open minded, more radical, more accepting and critical, but people in power are just all conservatives, unwilling to accept change.

This lecture video shows that why many elders from Ken's generation often neglect the effects of climate change.More than 3/4 of carbon dioxide has been a contribution of Ken's generation. Unfortunately, the elder generation hasn't realized that and did not put effort into deal with the situation.they just attribute this increase as natural change, and other non-anthropogenic factors. I could notice that Ken really wants us to be a member of people who elaborate themselves on protecting the environment. But as he has said, there are still many of his fellows who are in the authoritative positions, and in the past decades, there were a few issues such as baby boomers, immigration that the government had confronted with. They believed the importance of such things outweighed the significance of environment protection. Therefore, the government has not valued this event.
<br><br>
It is sad to see the climate change deniers to use multiple ridiculous explanations to defense their beliefs.So what we should do is to rationally and devote our efforts into this issue and make our planet much greener and better place for all the creatures to live.

<p>
The video “Why the generation that caused climate change is not acting” goes over why the people of older generations that caused all these issues to begin with are not doing anything. At first, I was mad to hear that a lot of those people are refusing to do anything. They continue to push it aside and continue to add to their mistakes. Then I thought about it. They are not going to put in the effort when it really is not going to affect them at all. They are leaving soon and we will be left with what we have now. Even worse is that we newer generations are still yet to be informed of all the problems of climate change since there is a lot of disbelief coming from our elders that pass onto us. 
<br><br>

Our elders aren’t doing anything because they don’t feel the need too. Nobody feels the need to make a change unless it is going to affect them personally and since it won’t affect the generations that started it anymore, they just hardly care or bring thought to the issue. What they need to realize is that even though they are on their way out, they are still continuously making it worse, and therefore harder, for this new generation to clean up their mess. This is a message to this older generation that started all this: At least buy us some more time by helping with what you can. Stop doing things that are worsening are planet while you are still here. Make an impact before you leave us. You started this now help us fix it. Think about your grandkids and future great great grandkids. There are things they aren’t even going to be able to see in this world. Things you seen in the world will now likely only be able to be shown to newer generations through pictures. Think about how life is going to be even when you’re gone because even though it won’t affect you, it’s affecting others.

I wholeheartedly agree with this comment. Fighting climate change has to be a collective effort. This includes all the people living on Earth and excludes no one. I think that Ken emphasizes the mistakes of his generation because it serves us as a lesson that teaches us the consequences of ignorantly ignoring the severity of anthropogenic climate change. But it's too late to teach boomers new habits and perspectives. I say we focus on educating the future generations as much as we can about climate change and living an environmentally conscious lifestyle. Similar to many of the civil rights movements closer to the end of the 20th century, we must change we rhetoric about an issue that has long been ignored by older generations and bring awareness that not only pursues to educate about the issue but also garners support. We simply just don't have the time to be patient with people who oppose the idea of anthropogenic climate change. Ken illustrates the common mentality amongst denialists, whom unfortunately, make up the majority of the people in power. But maybe even worse than denialist are hypocrites, because hypocrites can be found cross generationally. The people who say that they are all about fighting climate change but their only contribution to the fight is reposting NASA pictures on their instagram story. We need to first set an example for future generations so that being pro earth is not only just a trend but a serious lifestyle. I'm starting to fight climate change by beginning to look at my daily habits and decisions and thinking about ways I could be environmentally conscious in the hopes to set a better example for my little sister. It is really important to remember that change starts with you.

This video make me more clear about why older generation do not care much about the climate crisis and even deny the happening of climate crisis. Ken mentioned in the video that his generation was actually causing most of the carbon dioxide emissions of today. But people from his generation didn’t make any effort on trying to help environment but just causing pressure on climate. Although there are still many denial of the happening and severity of climate crisis nowadays. And most of the officer of relevant institutions are from the older generation. Young generation are now put most of their efforts on explaining the climate crisis and helping improving the environment, trying to make a change.

Within this lecture Ken addresses how coming to grips with climate change for many is difficult for them.Years and years of tarnishing the world's atmosphere and not realizing the harmful effects being done, many don’t want to take responsibility for. So in turn,it is not surprising that many people are in a state of denial, what is however surprising is that people in denial seriously have the audacity to question scientists and question them for their research on climate change. They choose to blame other groups of people and never want to take responsibility for their actions. This lecture introduces the astonishment of CO2 gas emissions being on the rise far more quickly now than when the Paris Accord was signed. In 2015 CO2  had risen 0.5% and in 2018 it had risen 5 times that at 2.7% It’s a scary thought to know that if we don’t act now upon this climate crisis issue then we can expect these numbers to increase over the next few years.

It's pretty terrible that such a small group of people (relatively) have had such an effect on the lives of countless others, not only people, but all life in general. As was said in class, the baby boomer generation will likely go down in history as the generation that denied the consequences of their actions, and ultimately caused, or at least accelerated the current mass extinction. Obviously it isn't the entire generation's fault, there are a minority that believe in the science of climate change, but unfortunately it isn't enough. Out of all of the humans that have ever lived, and will ever live, baby boomers of developed countries will be the ones that are remembered for playing the biggest role in destroying the world, if the younger generations are unable to save it.

<br><br>

That being said, it is now the younger generation's responsibility to do something to stop the climate crisis. While it may not be our fault yet, it will be if we do nothing about the situation and simply continue to blame older generations. Climate change has continued to accelerate in the last 10 years, even as younger generations begin to have more influence on the state of the world. We can blame the government that is dominated by members of the older generation, which of course has a huge impact on how the country responds to climate change, or we can fight to have a positive impact that will overcome their negative impact. If we really want to save our home, we cannot continue blaming older generations and using them as an excuse for inaction. We have made many calls for action, now we need to make such action happen.

"Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting" brought up the point that most climate deniers are from the developed world. I definitely agree with this particular statement because people in developed areas don't tend to feel the effects of climate change as much as those in developing areas. In one of my classes last quarter, my professor brought up how when an event is further away,  the less important it is to an individual. The closeness of an event determines how an individual is going to react and whether or not they will demand for policy change. Right now, a lot of the negative events due to climate change are impacting the developing world the most. It's sad that people continue to deny climate change just because they themselves haven't experienced the negative effects. Even when they see these events on the news, they continue to minimize the impact these people are facing. It's sad to say that these individuals will probably not realize the extent of climate change until they themselves are impacted, which is something I don't wish anyone to go through. A lot of the statements Professor Ken mentioned that climate change deniers use astonished me. All I could think of was what would a scientist gain from lying about climate change? Corporations have more to gain from lying than scientists. Despite this, I still feel that Professor Ken is right about communicating and educating people about climate change (whether it's our parents, grandparents, etc.) can help people become more aware. Awareness is key in my opinion with a situation like this because it helps guide people to start making changes in their lives that are more environmentally friendly. Even though it might feel that we have no power against corporations, our right to vote and how we spend our money is very important to combat those in power and have our voices heard on a larger scale.



</p><hr>


<p>
The lecture video, “Why the generation that caused climate change is not acting” gives a explanation to why a lot of older people is not acting. Older generation, especially those who from developed countries, were simply denying the fact that climate crisis is a pressing issue. And they found easy way out that they lived mostly in a time when climate changes were little and scientist are corrupted (how dumb). It shows how selfish those people have been living: benefiting from the fossil fuel industries and leaving later generations with pollution and crisis without caring the issue.

<br><br>

As a person born in 90s from a developing country, I am frustrated and feel it is unfair that older generations from developed countries were selfish and indifferent to climate crisis. My country has been blamed for producing the largest amount of CO2 since 2007 yet still we produce much less than most developed country per capita without mentioning that we are the world's manufacturer. However, without a shared internet platform, developed countries rarely realize the effort our country has made. We have recovered forests as large as entire France, have electrified railways more than 30,000 kilometers, possess half of the electric cars sale. If our generation, no matter nationality, join such revolution in using green energy and recover nature, we can make great changes for our generations and those to come.



</p><hr>


<p>
In the lecture video, “Why the generation that caused climate change is not acting,” I am truthfully exposed to the reasons why my generation is not responding to the climate crisis the way the earth is begging us to. First off, it is absurd that we have to convince people that climate change is real. The fact that some individuals are so close minded about the changes in our environment is sad and sickening. It really doesn't even take the most intelligent person to realize what is happening in our world. Next, I feel like it is hard to blame Ken's generation alone for causing climate change. Although there was a sharp increase in CO2 during the time he was alive,  it is almost inevitable our generation is bound to do the same. We live the same, if not even more careless than the boomer generation. The only bummer now is that our generation is stuck with this sort of unsolvable issue that we have to take extreme measures to mediate. We do have technology on our side though and although the use of technology is ironic in that it contributes to our carbon footprint massively, it allows each and every one of us a outlet for sharing and making people around us aware of what is happening.

The most important thing I take from this lecture is the importance of precise, thoughtful action against global climate change, and quickly. The rich & powerful have power that i’m sure surpasses our wildest dreams, but the oil tycoons and other irresponsible business people should be held to their actions.  Realistically, this must be one of the largest most extensive massacres in human history. Millions of global citizens feel the horrible ramifications, and no one is being punished or reprimanded for the action that caused it. However, as important as that is, the planet must first be tended to.



</p><hr>


<p>
It is very complex from both a moral standpoint and a practical one to assign blame for this crisis in it's entirety. The lack of action by the last two generations has hurt future generations very much. There was knowledge of the danger of our carbon emissions for a long time and an even greater wealth of knowledge in the last two decades. Many people in the past 60 years have opposed change for the sake of comfort. It has created inequality in who will take the greatest amount of damage. It is understandable that without living in a certain time there is a great difficulty in getting your view out from the mainstream perspective and finding need for change. The greatest help that could be given now is move for change now. Late does not mean impossible, the parents and grandparents of the college aged students can help now with lifestyle changes and especially voting choices. Unlike in their time there is now true tangible evidence of damaged caused by changes in climate. This makes is certain more people will move from the fence to action.

I thought this video brought a lot of reasonable explanations as to why older generations don’t like to take action against climate change; however the more I understand why the older generations don’t “believe” in climate change, the angrier I become. It’s hard to see any of these reasons as anything more than selfish when the climate crises is effecting so many living things. It feels aggravating that some people are willingly killing our planet for profit during the short time they are on the planet.



</p><hr>


<p>
It’s very hard for me to be angry at the “boomer” generation for not acting. I acknowledge that they knew, I understand they could have done more and that they can do more now. But I know how in the past it was easy ignore what seemed like hard work. I understand why you’d want to avoid change, focus on yourself and your families, slip into agreement with the side who offers you a life with one less thing to worry about.I sympathize. I can’t be angry. Not that I’m not angry at CEOs or billionaires or politicians or whoever that allows the Top amount of emissions to be spent (like oil companies, the defense program, or people with seven mansions and a private jet). I can be dissapointed and frustrated but its hard to be judgmental about people who fundamentally were just trying to live their bests. But people who now who either cling to what they aligned themselves with decades ago or who acknowledge they were wrong but won’t make lifestyle changes (because again: change is hard) it is a lot harder to not judge them. If you know what you are doing is wrong, that it is hurting people, that you are hurting everyone, then why on eaerth not make a change. Ignorance is not an excuse anymore. Why should older people be allowed to be scared and “weak” and not make hard choices and admit their wrong while we have to. And why wouldn’t they want to? Sure the majority of climate change is being caused by huge corporations or whatever but if enough people make small (or big) lifestyle changes it will help! And if everyone on the planet makes significant lifestyle changes then not only would that buy us a little time, it might be enough to convince “corporations” that going green is worth it. (Sidenote: when I say “corporations” does anyone know who I’m talking about? Is that like the military? “Big Coal?” This is a legitimate questions: Outside of individual people, what entities are producing the most carbon emissions.)

I think that this lecture brings up the important point that Ken's generation is the generation who have mainly caused the climate crisis, but seem to care the least about it. It is even more disheartening to know that these are the people who are mainly occupying the political power within out nation. Despite this being the case, I think that it is still important for our generation to make the best out of our situation by aggressively seeking reform from them and the rest of the world, especially the nations that are large contributors to the carbon footprint being left on the planet. Just because we were left with a huge mess to clean up does not mean that we should allow history to repeat itself by turning a blind eye to the deteriorating state of our planet and leave it to the future generations to be hardly left with a planet to try to save. We must learn from the mistakes of those who came before us in order to never make them again, but it is unfortunate that the cost of such grave mistakes is our only habitable planet. I think that on top of my generations efforts to save the planet, those belonging to older generations who caused the problem should be doing their best to inform others and seek redemption through positive actions of helping the planet. It isn't enough to simply be sorry, change must come with that apology as well.

It is astonishing to see that the older generation ignored climate change because they believed it was nonsense. I'm very glad that more people are starting to realize how heavy the situation is currently, but it is heartbreaking to witness how there are still so many individuals out there in society who are extremely selfish. There are many people in poorer countries who are being blamed for the actions committed by richer people. The wealthy has consistently caused so many climate changes from greenhouse gas emissions, release of carbon dioxide, and etc. But the fact that they put so much blame on the poor people when they are the ones who are suffering the most is very frustrating to me. 
<br><br>

Also I believe it is extremely selfish for politicians to push the agenda that climate change isn't real. They try to trick many people in society that climate change is absurd and shouldn't be supported. These kinds of elected officials are one of the main reasons why actions to take care of climate change is being constantly delayed in this moment. There should be more politicians who address this issues and who are supported by people who actually care and hope for a better change in this world. Without that kind of support, climate change would be prolonged indefinitely while the actions will be delayed.

Honestly, speaking the first video made me angry and disappointed in the previous generations. Watching this video allowed me to get inside the mind of the older generations and understand why climate change is such a lack of priority. It is incredibly easy to get caught up with everything that life throws at you, so it makes much more sense to focus on problems in social policy and the economy rather than something like climate change. These people were fed the idea of the American dream and as commodities were made and life got more comfortable, people began to indulge.  ¾ of the carbon dioxide that is in the atmosphere was put there in the past 6 decades but the effects of it are barely coming into fruition. If you live your whole life at a certain standard of luxury and see none the consequences it has on the natural environment then, of course, you won’t be motivated to act. Not only that, but I believe this generation has a different relationship to the government and often the misinformation on climate change affects their attitudes. Throughout history, we see the natural trend of older generations being more conservative while younger generations are more liberal and I think this manifests itself as the older generations having a greater sense of trust in the government. When the news comes on with segments on climate denial it's easier for them to accept this and feel less guilt especially when they haven’t seen the consequences of climate change first hand. Now while I can understand why older generations caused the climate crisis and don’t care, a great sense of despair grows upon me. As Ken mentioned in the video, the time for climate intervention is quickly fading and the time to act was in the past 6 decades. The youth doesn’t really have political clout unless it's in mass movements, and I think the problem hasn’t become severe enough for everyone to want to take action. This really causes me to question what the future has in store.

Before watching this lecture video, I already knew it was going to cover the concerns that the younger generations have for the older ones who are in denial about climate change. It's as though it goes through one ear and out the other and it's unfortunate that only a small percentage is willing to help out. Raising awareness is one of the first steps towards making change, but ultimately it's one of the hardest steps to do. It's easier said that done. It can get frustrating to deal with stubborn individuals who hold most of the power in our country to get them to listen. Industrialized countries hold majority of the power which affects the rest of the world and it's crazy to think that one's beliefs and opinions can be either validated or thrown into the abyss. Except that in this case, it affects the earth and everything and everyone on it and so one would assume there would only be one sided arguments, but in fact there's so many theories coming from those who deny climate change overall. There's much work that needs to be done for future generations and that's very unfortunate. :(

In the case of baby boomers, the lack of action is caused by the fact that they do not need to face the repercussions of their actions. Baby boomers make up the large majority of people that hold power and wealth; this makes it harder for climate change activists to be heard. They do not care that scientist warn against dire effect and show proof that our planet is changing in drastic ways. They are blinded by money, which subsequently robs them of their ability to sympathies with those who do not have the resources nor time to survive such devastation and change to the planet. The only way to combat this is through educating society as a whole. The younger generation and those who heed the words warning of climate change should try their hardest to fight for the cause in order to slow down the inescapable effects of human pollution. Indirectly, people with knowledge about this plight should try to vote and be as politically active as possible in order to increase the voice of reason.

I think perhaps one factor that could further explain the reason why climate change is a lesser concern the more generations you go back is simply the desire for policies that are more likely to affect them. The older generations have not and likely will not see the full effects of climate change and thus legislation such as the Green New Deal is unlikely to impact them positively and instead takes away resources from policies that could affect the economy, which affects them much more immediately. Even the older folk that do acknowledge the issue are less likely to care because they will not be there to see the full effects of climate change play out. The amount in which they care relies on their level of empathy for us, while the amount in which our generation care relies on our survival instinct. However, as mentioned in the other video, the youth have half of the voting power of the older generations. This creates a clear disparity in the priorities of the youth and the elderly, worsened by the fact that a good portion of our political office is made up of those same people that already make up a large part of the voter base. The clear solution is to have more of the current generation partake in the voting process, but the real question is how do we persuade them without causing them to turn away in annoyance at the overwhelming amount of information being thrown at them constantly? I think the biggest part of why people tune out the issue is that they don't know much about the issue beyond that it's happening and a few key developments, but they do not truly understand what is going on. We should all do our best to inform the people around us of what is truly happening and the future that we are very rapidly approaching.

I find it quite horrifying how the generation that caused this damage deny climate change just because they haven't seen much of its consequences. Their ignorance is causing extreme and unimaginable damage for generations such as myself. What also pains me to hear is that half or more of the world that did not contribute to CO2 being released is going to suffer the most. They did absolutely nothing to deserve this, yet older generations continue to sit back, relax, and let the younger generations try to reverse any damage we possibly can at this point in time. Many animals are suffering as well. They couldn't possibly have done anything to contribute to the deterioration of our earth, yet they are dying in masses everyday. I can't help but look at these older generations as selfish human beings that don't care about our future just because they won't be apart of it due to age. They are continuing their contribution to climate change to this day as well! I hope they soon realize to a higher degree that what they are doing is slowly but surely ruining the future for their kids and grandkids.

In the video “Why the generation that cause climate change is not acting” Professor Hiltner shows us that his generation is in large part why we are in this mess and that they still don't care. When he mentioned the fact that baby boomers ranked global warming as “18/29” as a concern and issue for the 2020 election I was appalled. How can something that affects everything on earth be ranked so lowly. The amount of ignorance in people today is ridiculously high. Hearing about the huge crisis we are in that was primarily not our fault is truly saddening. Luckily in the video “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis” Professor Hiltner lets us know what we can do.
<br><br>

In last week's assignment what we had to read and watch was all very disheartening and left myself and most individuals with no hope. Lucky in the aforementioned video Professor Hiltner guides. One thing we all can do to better the planet is to vote. Vote for the people that are fully aware of the issues and plan on tackling them and vote on laws that promote a healthy planet. To say that you want to save the planet but you're too lazy to vote is a disservice not only to your fellow comrades but also a disservice to yourself. Do yourself a favor and vote!

People cannot sacrifice the environment for development. The climate crisis is more serious than before from generation to generation. I feel sorry for that people in Ken's generation cannot do anything about the climate change. But in my generation, I need to appeal all peers to take actions on climate crisis. It's not only just for us but also for our children and children's children, to give them a home without extreme weather.



</p><hr>


<p>
In Ken's "Why the generation that caused climate change is not acting," the professor elegantly explores the reason why older generations of 1st world people don't view climate change as a problem plaguing all of humanity. I found it incredibly ironic that the generation that help create the issue also deny its existence and impact on our planet. Similarly, that fact the global issue isn't a priority for them because they most likely won't have to deal with or see worsening natural disasters  conveys their lack of empathy for others and highlights their greed and ignorance. However, I remain optimistic that newer generations of people will believe in the facts and push for solutions to counteract climate change.

After watching this video, it makes more sense how the older generation does not want to take action with preventing climate change. They did not have any effects during their youth and feel that since they lived their life free of any effects that should not worry about anything. Their failure to realize the condition of the Earth puts my generation at the forefront of preventing the effects of getting worse or even try to reverse it. Although most baby boomers did not care before about the effects of fossil fuel, some are now starting to open their eyes to the detrimental effects that have occurred. For example, in my household , my parents who are both baby boomers did not care much about doing anything to help the environment but today they put in the effort to cut our waste production and use of plastic around the house. Although it may seem like a small action, it has larger effects in the long run.

After watching this video, I felt sad that people do not think they cause the change in the environment. But what people does cause the negative influence on the environment. Nowadays, our life could not live without mine. Mine does give our life convenience; however, it also cause some bad effects. With the greenhouse gases, the climate changes a lot which cause the temperature becomes higher and the sea level to rise. Many species are threatened with extinction and glaciers are melting at the poles. Although no one directly cause these changes, the whole development of the modern society make this change. Nowadays, the young generation become awareness of this change and take efforts to help the environment become better. Many organizations devote to make the environment better. People should not continue ignoring this terrible changing. What I think is that people should change their lifestyle to be more environmental friendly, such as taking public transportation, turning off the light when leaving, and using less unnecessary water.

This lecture video explains very well why older people are not addressing the climate crisis as an important issue. I agree with Ken in that the huge delay in the consequences has a lot to do with it. The older generation lived their whole life with these emissions of CO2 without seeing any consequences, so they believe it is all a hoax. Many of them are just in denial and try to come up with excuses such as saying that the scientists are corrupt. It is unfair to see that the older generation not wanting to address the issue and continuing to harm our planet and they won’t have to face the major consequences of their actions. It is also unfair to see that the US is one of the top contributors to the CO2 emissions, but those who will be affected by our actions are those who are poorer and have no fault in this crisis. 
<br><br>
We need to make a change as stated in Ken’s next video. We need to take control of this country in order to make progress since those in charge are the older generation who do not think of this as an immediate threat. We need to act quickly if we want there to be a future for us and future generations.

First of all, I am not super surprised by the reaction of the older generation towards climate change. It makes sense how they feel towards a problem where the greatest effects will be felt by this world at the very end of their lives. It makes me happy when I see people of our own generation, the youth, rising up to take the mantle and speak out against climate change. It's how it should be. I am extremely appreciative of Ken's work in educating our generation on such a depressing topic that needs to be taught if we are to hope for survival.
<br><br>

My only wish is that the previous generation would do more to aid our struggle against climate change. Realistically, we can't expect all wars to end and the entire world to just flip to renewable energy (obviously this would be great), but I just wish the older generation would work towards making small switches in themselves to help combat climate change. They don't even have to go vegan, but going vegetarian would no doubt prove very healthy for a country in dire need of nutritional reform. Go out there and get educated, educate others and realize that just because it won't directly affect you, doesn't mean the problem should be ignored.

Yes i agree with you, it is reasonable for older folks to not be as caring about the effects of climate change and our absurd amount of co2 output as they will not be feeling the huge repercussions from it. However, it is quite ridiculous how previous generations have noticed climate change long ago and even made policies revolving the idea of slowing down on c02 emissions output and protecting our planet but still didn't take action. With the Paris agreement being nearly 4 years old now change still yet to be noticed as large enough action is not being taken. It has fallen into the hands of our generation now to persuade policymakers, promote acts against environment destroying lifestyles, and to take action. The failure of other generations to take action has fallen into the burden of our own hands and is quickly becoming our responsibility. Additionally, I as well am extremely appreciative of the work Ken is doing to educate the public about this current crisis and his passion for it is absolutely remarkable as his teachings are truly applicable to real life.

Today I sat down
with my father and introduced to him what I have been learning in
ClimateCrisis101. He too is a member of your generation, therefore I
anticipated that he would respond in one of two ways. I figured that he would
either feel guilty about the fact that climate change is mostly a result of the
actions performed by the developed world in his lifetime or that he would carry
out his usual skeptical perspective or one of denial. To my surprise, after
having shared the film, "Before the Flood" which I found to be an
elaborate, well put together recap of the climate crisis that lives upon us, he
responded by inspiring me to be a catalyst of change. While it was a more
positive response than negative, I can see why he did not feel a sense a
urgency for himself. As you say in your lecture, older generations simply don’t
consider it to be a problem worthy of their concern. My father said to me,
"we are now on our way out, its up to the youth to make a change and
decide what kind of life they want to live, if that is you don’t get wiped
before then." This kind of response is typical of ken's generation, I feel because the fact of the matter is, that  what they do or did is no longer going to affect them directly, while it will most certainly affect their offspring, and their offspring's offspring, this issue is one that my father feels is no longer in his control or his responsibility which can be a crude position given that it is his generation that is primarily responsible.

Just like you I also spoke to my parents about the climate change crisis and what I had been learning in class. Luckily for me, my parents after understanding the complexity of the climate change issue and ways to help actually became vegan. It has been a few weeks and I am extremely proud of them. I do believe that "Before The Flood" was a significant catalyst in their change in mindset.

I think it is definitely easier to for the older generation to be selfish in the sense that their actions won't affect them as much as it will us. Given that I understand why the older generations are less inclined to take the blame for what they have done. Although it's not fair, it's up to my generation to fix what has been messed up. What really strikes me are the climate change deniers. To disagree with scientists and propose a much more far fetched idea just to avoid blame further increases the issue. But it is too late to educate the older generations and help them realize how real climate change is. Instead what we need to do is put people who are committed to putting the planet over financial gains in office.

It is disappointed that people of Ken's generation did nothing about climate change. Many people choose to ignore and even deny the climate change in order to develop energy or resources. Protecting the environment is a long process, so if we want give our next generations and their children a livable environment, we need take actions right now.

<p>
It is really not that surprising that the older generations care more about social security and healthcare whereas the younger generations care more about climate change. We see what is right in front of us, and this short-term mindset is particularly troubling. The negligence of climate change due to human activities is making the climate change out of control. I think as we are tackling the problem of climate change, we need to remember that our actions today will affect the next generations to come, positively or negatively, and we will be responsible for it.
  <br><br>
  Speaking of our generation taking up the challenge of resolving the climate crisis, it seems like there is so much to do, yet so little to do. Yes voting will help push for the change and spread the message, yes changing our life styles bit by bit will help, but is it really enough? It is easy to feel lost at some point about this huge mess, and I hope that the rest of the course can give a better picture of what must be done.

People from Ken's generation don't care about making changes to their habits because it's not like the climate crisis is going to affect them drastically because by the time it gets really bad, they will all be dead. The people who are going to be left on this inhabitable Earth are the younger generations. As Ken mentioned in the video, a big reason as to why nothing has been done to reverse the effects is because it is a generational issue. The older people are, the less they care about the Earth's condition; but these same people are the ones with the power. The crazy thing is that people are aware that it is human caused and are still so selfish and unwilling to change because it isn't directly affecting them. This means that it is up to my generation and along with younger generations to get our voices heard because we are the ones that will have to live through this. It's was also upsetting to hear that border control and immigration were higher up on the list of important issues than climate change. How are people more concerned about who is in America if we are all going to die within a few decades.

After watching this video, it is more clear to me why older generations like our grandparents do not believe in climate change. I remember trying to talk to my grandma about climate change and she was always in denial. She believes that climate change is something that people have made up. I told her everything that I knew about climate change before taking this class and she basically told me I was dumb for believing all that. Older generations are so stubborn and refuse to believe that climate change exists because all the nature disasters seem normal them and never grew up knowing anything about climate change because they believed that would never exist.
  <br><br>
Just like most our grandparents, the government who are around their age are also in denial. Most of their generation of responsible for the rise of climate change however we can not just blame it on them. There are many like Ken trying to fix the mistakes that their generations made but it has been very difficult due to the small amount of activists that there is. They want to help our generation and are continuing to help us find ways to control climate change. One of the solutions Ken keeps talking about is voting and he strongly encourages our generation to make that change by voting and electing members that will listen to our voice and protect our planet for the future generations.

As morbid as it sounds, I believe the idea that the generation largely responsible for the climate crisis is either indifferent/defensive over their actions because they will be dead before they can feel the repercussions. Although many do outright deny climate change, I think that many of them also harbor fear over how climate change will change the planet for the worse, and instead of admitting this will use denial as a deflection. In regard to the government and big corporations, there is no doubt that they have at least some idea of what is happening, but once again use denial or lie in order to protect their status and power. Considering that the government is largely controlled through the financial grasp of these big corporations, I believe that this is not too far of a stretch to think about.
  <br><br>


That being said, that is one of the reasons why our generation needs to start acting, especially on the behalf of some of those in the older generations (such as Ken for example) who believe in the climate crisis but do not have enough influence or power within their own demographic to make an impact themselves. This upcoming election will be important, as it will be the first time that a large amount of the Gen Z will get to participate in a major election. Given that we make a strong enough showing, it will make a statement to the older generation in power that says, "enough is enough, it's time for a change."

I believe that it is the older generations fault for failing us in the climate crisis. Because of the older generation's failure we must take it upon ourselves to make the world a sustainable place to live for future generations. One of the most important things to me is that we elect government officials that clearly care about environmental causes, like Bernie Sanders, and do not elect people who will lie to the public because giant corporations are funding their campaign. We must enforce acts that will force corporations to be more eco-friendly and put human lives over profits. It is somewhat understandable that older generations were not aware or we not made to care enough back then but for our generation today to ignore the scientific proof that is being proven everyday and not do a single thing is selfish and unjust.

That is pretty shameful for the former generation as professor Ken is in did not consider climate change for a significant problem for human at all. Because of the layback consequences, people ignored the possible and potential problems that would highly affect the future for their offspring, the next generation as which I am in now. For the voting through different ages, I can clearly see that even that many of consequences has already came for us, some of the last generation still take this environmental issue like several decades ago. Times goes fast, so as environment. Even human its self is changing every second, do not except the surrounding keeping the same every decade. So, not try to be exaggerating about the current situation, but really, even if the nowadays generation begins to do something to make the climate crisis slowing down a little bit, the human cannot make the former climate back. However, the thing is that the young generation can do something with it compared to the last generation. We try to foresee the result if we do the same as the last generation did before, and obviously we get it from the change of climate in these years. Maybe professor would feel shameful when professor’s daughter asks what his generation did with the climate change. But hopefully, the young generation as us can tell his daughter that we actually do something helping the environment, the place we living in.

The lecture was very informative in the aspect of why Ken's generation is not acting. I believe one of the major points was the time delay. They began to release greenhouse gases during development.  Without consequences, they ignored the warnings of scientists because the consequences had not caught up. I understand why people might believe that this is the  'natural cycle of climate', because there are good days and others where there are bad storms but now the severity of the effects is increasing. The climate crisis is upon us and is affecting , like Ken mentioned, those who have a minimal impact, other species suffering and dying in mass, and the children of those who contributed. It is upsetting to know that climate change is not a priority for many. It wasn't a surprise that the older generations such as the Baby Boomers, Gen X , and those 75+ rank climate change 15 and below in the matter of importance. What is worrisome is that the newer generations will be the ones who face the consequences. I do believe that many in the older generations might not take action because they won't live through the future catastrophic events that await us, that is if we don't take action.



</p><hr>


<p>
I am not exactly surprised by the part in the video where Ken discusses how boomers and gen x rank the severity of climate change, yet it still makes our situation seem much more bleak. When you consider the fact that these people have no vested interest in looking after the planet/trying to right their wrongs, it makes it seem so much less likely that they will assist the younger generation in initiating change. While the younger generation is doing (I think) an amazing job rallying and gaining momentum to begin a real climate revolution, in a more realist frame of mind I realize that the people in this country who are in power are not my contemporaries. Boomers still hold most government positions, and they are some of the people who care the least about climate change. Its hard to feel hopeful when there are so many people acting as barriers to our attempts at change.

To combat climate change people have to evolve past their own evolution. Our species has created endless technological advancements that help us in everyday life, however what we don't realize is that these things are contributing to our own destruction. The generation before, which contributed a big amount to climate change, is not taking action because the fact that it's really not their problem. It affects the generation after them which now has to pick up the slack. But let's face it what can we really do about climate change. My individual effort to stop climate change has not nearly enough impact as I wish it did. The only way I see actual change is if somehow there was government regulation on CO2 emission. Political action is the only way to see change on a big scale however money and greed play a hand in it all. Of course it would be possible to switch to better and more efficient fuels but why would anybody give up a billion dollar industry. Change is never easy and it does take time but the longer we wait the harder it will be for us to counteract the climate crisis.

Anthropogenic climate change is a moral issue as it involves one group of humans harming others-- people of past generations harming our future generations, people in developed world harming those in developing world, and the overall mass extinction we have triggered that harms all life on earth. It upsetting to know that the past generations messed up, and have really made It hard for us to see a future for our grandchildren; and it's worse to think that those who are to blame are still the ones in power. Plus, to know that our lifestyle has caused us (along with Russia and Europe) to emit 3/4ths of all the CO2 in the atmosphere; and having the poorest half of humanity suffer (who had nothing to do with it). I hate that past generations were warned about their consequences as climate crisis has been a topic of debate for decades, yet the fossil fuel economy meant more to them than the future of their children. And it's more upsetting that they are still in denial about the consequences to their actions and will not take responsibility. 
  <br><br>
Regardless, I do believe in my generation, and being in a class about climate crisis with 800 other individuals who believe in it the same way most of us do, only showcases that there are people out there that want to see a future for our grandchildren and to save our oceans, forests, and put an end to the natural disasters. We will be known as the generation that saves all other generations, as long as we all work together and continue to climate crisis conversation outside the class and with our grandparents, and inform our younger siblings, then together we can survive this crisis.

I have personally heard people use the excuse "the climate is always changing" to justify why climate change isn't real. Hypothetically, even though there is obvious evidence supporting its existence, if climate change isn't real it's still really weird to me that people are still okay with pumping that much CO2 into our atmosphere. By just simply breathing anyone can see that air quality is being seriously effected by CO2.  Without clean air, we would not be able to survive. Also, how do people not make the connection that without our earth everything would cease to exist? You can't worry about the economy, terrorism, or any other issue without having our earth. Everything begins with our earth!

I told my dad I was taking the climate crisis class and he sort of started to make fun of it and say it's just one of those required classes I need to take. It kind of amazes me how time after time he can just deny that there is severe climate change going on, believing that evidence after evidence is false and this is just a cycle of the Earth. Another day Greta Thunberg came up in our conversation, and he just said: "oh she's just still too young and impressionable by the world" saying that she truly does not understand what she is talking about and is too liberal. Greta has said that this is not a politics thing and she does not support one side or the other with this, she is just drawing attention to the severity and calling for action. I feel like the older generations, much like older generations from them, and older generations from them, are reluctant to change and do not want to change their habits. There has been and always will be traditionalists and people progressing new ideas. However, I believe this is greater than new progressive ideas. This is about the future of the world. The older generation needs to realize that future generations are not going to be able to have the same lives as them. And if by chance this all happens to be false (which it isn't) there is no harm in trying to change, as there are many more benefits than just helping the climate such as creating a better life for impoverished and struggling people around the world. I hope the past generation can get the idea that this is just like another hippie movement from the young kids and actually realize that serious problems are coming to the world.

I know many members of the older generation that continue to deny the legitimacy of climate change. I agree with Ken's "delay of time" point and it's a very logical reason that the older generation doesn't believe in climate change because they haven't truly experienced the consequences of their actions. This takes me to my next point: your statement about the future generations not being able to experience the world in a way that older generations have. It's always troubled me that the older generations can't understand the fact that, sure, it won't affect you, but it affects your children, your family, your friends. Take care of the planet and accept what's going on for the benefit of your loved ones!

It is indeed alarming that 3/4's of carbon emissions has been released in the last 60 years, however it does make complete sense. The past 60 years there has been a time delay where it does not even seem global warming was even happening. Due to the fact that there was a time delay caused many to speculate whether global warming was really a thing. Many became in denial because they haven't seen any of the bad. This causes many to question the variability of scientists although all of their data is there. More and more theories rise as a result such as believing it is just Earth's "natural cycles". These ideologies are most common in the developed world which also ironically causes the most co2 emissions. I think is is absolutely ridiculous that our country destroys the most while poorer countries contribute very little to the climate crisis yet they are receiving the most consequences. Those who have caused all of this are able to still live luxuriously as they have more money to better their lifestyle (making climate change worse) causing an endless cycle. This time delay makes climate change not a priority and are not seeing the consequences which is why the younger generations must take action now, even if these generations never change their minds it does not matter because they will be dead while we live with these consequences. I am glad that this generation can actually mitigate the climate crisis especially by voting. Now that I know voter turnout is giant portion of making change, I will assure I and others will vote.

Although it is upsetting that Ken’s generation is not taking measures to reduce the number of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere, I think it is time to accept that it will take more than hundreds of thousands of climate crisis protesters to change the minds of our government leaders. It will take the majority of the population to step up and advocate for change. Unless almost everyone is willing to transition from a fossil fuel-based life to solar, wind, or other renewable energy sources,  it will be tough to do so. The U.S. government will not be willing to give up the leading factor of our economy without major protest from Americans. As long as government officials are being paid and supported by fossil fuel companies, we can’t expect much change to take place at all. In order to make the change, we need to stop buying and using fossil fuels being produced by these major corporations. This way, after a period of time, not only will these companies be losing out on money, but they will be losing the money to renewable energy companies. Once this happens, and the renewable fuel companies start to gain significant figures, more windmills, solar panels, etc. can be put into use by Americans across the country. Another thing we must do to ensure the safety of the Earth and the organisms living on it is to vote. We must vote for the laws in favor of the environment no matter the cost because in the end, without a place to live, nothing else matters.

Watching these videos really makes me wonder how selfish the United States has been. Obviously climate change wasn't a huge problem in the past so the older generations went trigger happy and were care free with the amount of green house gases produced. I feel that the time delay made these older generations not believe scientists and their factual evidence that climate change was real. I find it really annoying that the younger generations and third world countries will have to deal with this problem. What I find even more annoying is that because of this time delay many people like our current president still do not believe that there is a climate crisis and it's going to be too late to act before everyone realizes it. I do appreciate that some older people are trying to make up for the harm they and their peers have caused to the environment, however they need to convince each other about this crisis, it can't be only up to the newer generations, we're still babies. I feel that the only thing that the people of my generation can really do is increase our numbers when voting and social awareness, however we have no actual power to stop big corporations ourselves. We also need to try and convince others to approve of things such as the Green New Deal and actually make sure these politicians do what they say they're going to do.

It is quite frustrating to see that in the poll done of the ranking of climate change as an issue, we saw that the older they were the less likely they were to find it as urgent, although they were the ones who caused this destruction they are unable to admit and take responsibility for their actions. I would have hoped that since they lived for most of it they would have at least been able to notice the climate crisis and help the newer generation fix what they have destroyed. Instead of denying it, they should be more supportive. But, I also get hope when I see newer generations invested in this problem because the only way to fix this is by coming together. 
  <br><br>
It also amazes me to see how climate delay effects why the older generations are in denial of climate change or see it as an issue that is not as important. Although it did not happen instantaneously, it is clear to see that climate change is real and even when people are given the facts and numbers they still choose to deny it.

I've heard many people saying that the U.S. has stagnated, and that it's no longer the best place in the world. A lot of people seem to agree that certain countries in Northern Europe are way better than the U.S. Others disagree and are stubbornly insistent that the U.S. is still a great place. Yet, slogans like "Make America Great Again," and "Change We Can Believe In," seem to imply that America sucks and needs change. 
  <br><br>
Well, where's the change? Why do people value change? Why is change so hard to achieve?
  <br><br>
It's easier to be complacent. If you're satisfied, then you don't need to improve or change as much compared to those who are dissatisfied. It's easier to be lazy or procrastinate. 
  <br><br>
If you're dissatisfied, perhaps you'll be motivated to change. Yet, if you've fallen into despair, then maybe you've lost the will to change. 
  <br><br>
You might've already known this. You might disagree or agree. I might be wrong or generalizing an entire race. If so, sorry. I'm a bit scared to write this. It's easy to be a hypocrite. It's hard to stop being one. 
  <br><br>
Climate activists get attacked for being hypocritical, which is quite unfair since almost everyone would be a hypocrite or denier. We were born into a world where we naturally, yet unnaturally, contribute to climate change. It's not really our fault we, as Americans, contribute so much to climate change. We were raised that way. Thus, blaming the older generation is easy. It's also easy to forget that some of them were also raised that way. We could blame so many generations for climate change. 
  <br><br>
Yet, we shouldn't forget to assign responsibility, not blame, to our generation. It's not entirely our fault, but it'll be our fault anyways if we don't change. 
  <br><br>
It's unfortunate that many of us don't want to change, since change is usually hard. Following habits is easy, and sometimes you won't even notice an extra 'the' in your sentence because you know 'the the' isn't a thing. Don't you like it when syllabi are posted with nice schedules telling you what's coming up at what time? Don't you feel more safe and secure when you know what's going to happen tomorrow in class? No pop quiz, whew. We've been raised to live in a way that contribues a lot to climate change, but we've also been educated to resist, or at least appreciate less, change. After all, "you can't teach an old dog new tricks." I've known that phrase ever since I was a child, but, actually, what's the difference between an old dog and a young dog if the young dog doesn't want to learn? Heck, maybe an old dog that wants to learn is better than a young dog who turns away and chooses not to learn. 
  <br><br>
The younger generation will be great at solving the climate crisis, but the issue is: many don't want to be great at solving the climate crisis. They'd rather be great at earning money or building a family or something else. When people make a wish on a cake or answer what superpower they want, they usually don't immediately think about the climate crisis. That's natural. That's okay. We should just be reminded that you can be great at earning money and etc. while being great at solving the climate crisis. Warren Buffet invests in renewable energy mainly for profit. Your family will be happier if you don't have your house burnt down or have to pay lots of medical bills. 
  <br><br>
Anyways, we should learn to embrace improvement and react better to unpleasant surprises. Change can be good or bad, but being able to adapt to both bad and good situations is helpful, especially since the climate crisis will soon force us to change. Making the same mistake because you don't want to or dare to change is honestly a bit sad. I bet coral would love to change (evolve) fast enough to survive. Meanwhile, we're ignoring, not noticing, or rejecting the many opportunities we have to change. When I say change, I don't just mean become more green. One person, however well-educated, cannot tell each individual how to change for the better, so the responsibility is on the individual. Our generation is responsible, but so are you.

After watching this video, I now understand why the old generation is so reluctant to take action. Hiltner’s generation are not just reluctant to take action but they are also in deep denial. What I don’t understand is how can they deny their impact when there is so much science that proves that humans are to blame. It’s alarming that by the time we might all finally come to terms that the climate crisis is real, it will be too late. It’s sad that the previous generation has left us with a planet in this state. 
  <br><br>

The fact that global warming ranked 18 out of 29 by baby boomers when asked what will be the most important issue for them in the upcoming 2020 election is appalling. It should be everyone’s  number one concern. Climate change is not a concern for the older generation because they know that they will not live long enough to see the devastation global warming will bring. It is completely unfair that they have left the new and coming generations with a terribly messed up planet. It’s astonishing to me how one generation managed to cause so  much destruction in such little time. My generation cannot afford this denial, because if we don’t take action now, there might not be a future for us.

I feel that the previous generation might be denying their impact, despite the science that proves that humans are to blame, because they are simply not well-informed about it. The climate crisis was definitely never a hot topic taught in their schools. I also think that the older generation might not care as much about climate change simply because they will most likely die before climate change really affects them. I also very much agree that climate change should be everyone’s number one concern. This is why it is very frightening to imagine that a climate denier could possibly be in office for a second term. There is so little time to act that these 8 years that Donald Trump could be president will have a significant impact on the future of the world, especially with the United States producing the second most CO2 in the world.
<br><br>
It makes me sad to realize that some of my peers do not believe in the climate crisis, or simply do not think that it is urgent. Even talking to some of my friends about it in high school they responded to me by saying that they’re sure “God has a plan.” Going up to visit my family in Merced during the drought, I would see signs that read “pray for rain.” With most of California’s agriculture around there, the drought hit hard. However, it's sad to see that some people that live there are climate change deniers, including my Conservative Christian family. Although I do see some change in this new generation, I am not sure that it is enough, as many of parent’s ideologies are passed down to their children.
<br><hr>
I completely agree that the reason older generations have largely denied and failed to act on the climate crisis is out of pure selfishness and a sole concern for what impacts them directly. They see no need to act because their comfortable way of life has never been significantly threatened until now. Many are very used to a certain materialistic standard of living and are simply unwilling to make the necessary changes to ensure that future generations have a livable future.

<br><br>

That said, I think we as members of the developed world have very little room to claim authority or attempt to shift blame to poor, undeveloped countries who simply do not have the resources or wealth to switch to clean forms of energy like the United States. The money is there for us. The top 1% of our country alone could each contribute a very small portion of their billions of dollars to construct enough solar and wind farms to power the entire continental United States. The simple reality is, our capitalistic corporations and policymakers are tied at the hip and have vested interests in the continued success of the fossil fuel industry. Until these individuals are voted out of power, nothing is going to change. There will be a future for us as citizens of the U.S. much longer than there will be one for the citizens of hard hit countries like India and Bangladesh.

After having learned all that I have in this class so far about climate change and how much of a pressing issue it truly is, the main question I had about it all was why it’s not an issue that people are acting on. This video answered that question. Although there are many who devote their time and energy in addressing the issue, this amount of people who are actually aiming to make a change is not nearly enough for a significant one to occur. It’s clear that many people don’t believe in climate change or it’s dangers. What’s ironic, and what this video explained, is that many of those people are the ones who contributed the most to the issue. People who are completely against believing in climate change, those who urge the public to ignore all of the clear evidence that climate change is a real thing, affecting our world more and more each day, those people happen to be the ones who are benefiting the most from the fossil fuel industry. Are we really expected to believe that this is simply just a coincidence? That scientists and others who study climate change and present it’s dangers are lying to us, and only doing so for their own benefit? Is this explanation really supposed to make more sense to us than one where climate change actually is causing danger to the future of our planet, and those who believe it isn’t are arguing so because they are benefiting from the processes in which are causing climate change to progress? The answers to these questions are obvious, which is what people need to realize in order to aim to make a change for the sake of our planet.

Just today I was in the car with my father driving to Oxnard, where my parents hope to buy a home and resettle from the Central Valley of California. During this hour car ride I spoke to my father about this class and the climate crisis. Through my dad is only 40 years old and has never had the means to seriously contribute to the climate crisis, he still views the problem in the same scope men 20-30 older than him do. This made me realize that my generation really is the last hope against the climate crisis. As the youth, just leaving the protected homes of our parents; the world seems so big and our life so long. This feeling makes us want to keep this Earth habitable for the entirety of our life and with hope, our future children's as well. Most predictions of serious climate crisis arise in the year 2050, in that year I will be 50 years old with a good chunk of my life still ahead. I do not want this time to be of struggle and natural disaster. My generation understands that though we did not create this problem, it is ours to fix. This is our world that is dying, we will be the ones who witness cities fall to the oceans and fires engulf our homes. Yet the Boomers still stand in our way! An essential part of the human experience stems from the shortness of our lives, we live, we love, we create and then we pass what we know to the next generation to continue the greatness of our species. In the modern world, this beautiful human experience has died as the old not only refuses to pass the torch but instead use it to set ablaze everything the human race has created. We must take back our earth from the hands of the old and take the actions needed to mitigate the problems they have created.

I think because of the attitude and actions of the older generation the younger generation loses motivation because they don’t see anything being done by those who are older. Older people don’t seem to take this issue as serious as they should which affects people who come later on and progress altogether. The youth is watching important figures say climate change isn’t real which creates a lack on their part. Furthermore, the younger generation is making more progress trying to help lessen the effects of all the CO2 being released in the atmosphere but all generations must work towards change if we want to see a real change in a short amount of time which must be done.

After watching the video “Why the generation that caused climate change is not acting”, professor Ken mainly talks about reasons of a lot of older people did not take an action and believe climate change is happening. I was shocked by the fact that there are so many denial of climate change in older generation. They deny global warming, deny climate change is caused by human, deny the findings from scientists, etc.
<br><br>


A fact that surprised me the most is denial of a climate crisis is most common in developed countries, but they are most responsible for this crisis. However, in poor areas, people suffered most from this situation made the least carbon dioxide emission. Actually, from my perspective, developed countries are supposed to lead the rest of the world to cut the emission of greenhouse gases because of their technological development, like the use of renewable resources. But they did just the opposite. Temperature raised in the United States is always higher than the average of the world’s raising temperature. However, President Donald Trump quitted Paris According at this time, which make the situation in the United States even worse. That is kind of selfish…

I agree with you that I found it ironic that the climate denial that has been created is found in the countries that are the most developed. You would think that the most developed countries in the world would have the most resources to tackle this big issue, but instead they are shooting themselves in the foot but having denial so terrible that it can wipe human life on earth.


<br><hr>

I agree, its completely selfish! The United States should be a leader in fighting global climate change, but instead, we are doing the opposite and that’s just wrong. Doesn’t this make us the bad guys? How is it justifiable for a Country to cause great harm to the entire planet but be able to avoid taking responsibility? I think that the reason why climate denial is most common in developed countries is because climate change would harm the consumeristic mindset of an already established lifestyle. I simply think its because people don’t want to change the way they live their easy and comfortable life. I also think it’s because of the industries that influence politics and policymaking within the country. Specifically, fossil fuel industries spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in spreading climate denial. Something needs to change within American society and American politics because the country should be creating positive change and leading the world, not the opposite.
<br><hr>
Yes, you are right. Political changing is also important to fight climate change.

This video only made me think of my parents. I do not blame them or get angry with them because I know that they are so unaware about climate change. My parents only know “global warming” and the surface ideas about it. This is why they caused it in my opinion. My parents didnt know enough, and the generation as a whole did not accept what they did know. Coming home to my parents and telling them this was a generational issue, they were confused. It only makes me want to educate them, not make them feel bad. The concern ranking was sad to look at because it just makes you think no wonder the previous generation was the cause of it, the ranks show that they do not care enough. The ranks and statistics showed that anyone over 40 years old do not see climate change as a priority. I think hearing that last part hit close to home because my parents, being over that age, makes me think how much do they care and know about the crisis we live in.

The lecture “Why this generation that caused climate change is not acting” is actually kind of frustrating to watch. It does give a reasonable explanation as to why older generations don’t put climate change as a priority, but it also shows that they are selfish. It was kind of sad to see where climate change ranked in voter’s concerns. It’s also really sad to think that people and animals who have hardly contributed to the climate crisis are going to get the worst of it. I liked how Ken included the ages of people who are in power (senators, supreme court, CEO”s, etc.) All of these people are on average 60-70 years old, whom of which don’t care about the climate crisis. It was also sad to hear that more people are saying they believe in climate change but still don't care to do anything about it because it won't really affect them.

<p>
I might hold the unpopular opinion here, but I am not mad at Ken’s generation for “causing” climate change, because I don’t necessarily believe they directly caused it, I don’t believe in laying the blame on the consumer of the products that are causing climate change but rather on the producers and the government for not putting harsher restrictions on the production of these products. I believe that not only is climate change a developed country versus not developed country issue but I also believe that in these developed countries that climate change is also largely a class issue. I don’t think the lower and middle class of developed country should be blamed but rather the upper class and top 1% as they are the ones that are not only producing a larger carbon footprint but are also the ones that can afford to cut down on the things that are causing climate change. What I am mad at Ken’s generation for is collective idea that Climate Change isn’t real because I think that rhetoric is far more threatening to anything that they contributed in the past.



</p><hr>


<p>
A grabbing point Ken highlighted in this lecture is the deep denial that baby boomers, Gen X, and those 75+ have about the severity and existence of climate change. The graph depicting these age groups’ ranking of climate change on importance was staggering because as a millennial, climate change is the most urgent and pressing disaster in my mind. I think about it every day, fear for the future of generations to come circulating constantly. It is continually frustrating to me that we can witness intensifying natural disasters, global warming, and scientifically measured carbon emissions tracking, and still be so stale in our actions. It is concerning that the subset of the population that doesn’t prioritize the crisis are the same ones prioritizing our political agenda. 
<br><br>

Personally, I have had issues attempting to sway my grandfather’s mind on the legitimacy of
anthropogenic climate impacts. In many heated debates, he alludes to his childhood of visible smog and the “strides” America has taken to reduce smog emissions and develop cleaner vehicles. However, I explain to him that he is missing the mark; climate change is not temporary fixes, but a gradual process that snowballs in intensity over time because of how we live. Right now, we are living in the worst environmental conditions to date. However, disappointingly, because the bulk of these older generations lack future-focus and are more concerned with their present financial security and lifestyle comfort, it does not hold the same value. It is an existential crisis for the young population and their future vulnerable families.

After watching this lecture video, I got a more clear perspective of what people are thinking about the climate crisis and why some of them are not inclined to act. As Professor Ken pointed out, “three quarters of all the carbon dioxide was put into our planet’s atmosphere in the last sixty years”. As a result, the air quality gets worse and worse. The idea that I want to point out and focus on is those groups that are not responsible for the current situation in our planet. They are innocent, and they should be suffer from problems that are not caused by them. They ought to live in a society that free of any air pollution, but sadly, it is impossible in anywhere of our world. Therefore, those countries and groups who contribute a lot carbon dioxide emission need to step up and help to solve the problem. Although there might be some essential issues as well, it is necessary to consider climate issue as one of the urgent issue need to resolve. We need to stop continuing destroying our earth. When we think those people, who live with a poor life as well as suffer from problems that they should not endure, we must warn ourselves that time goes quickly and people should put some ideas into exercise immediately.

I think some people choose to be in denial because it is the easier than accepting the truth. Like the saying goes, ignorance is a bliss. Accepting the climate crisis would mean changing the way you live and think completely. Climate delay, as mentioned in the lecture, has also played a huge role, especially in the generation prior to mine. It easy to deny something you’ve never seen and probably wont fully see in your lifetime. Even in my generation, some of us haven’t been exposed to the issue of climate change. 
<br><br>
	One of the big problems stopping the climate change movement here in the U.S. is the government. As mentioned in the lecture, many of the politicians in office are older and don’t prioritize climate change. Often times, I’m left feeling extremely frustrated that government is not taking is seriously, even when 70% of voters acknowledge anthropogenic climate change. The United States has invested so much money into our defense and security from outside threats, yet we don’t realize we may as well be our biggest enemies. For decades, our way of life has polluted the planet with unhealthy levels of toxic gases which will ultimately lead to the end of our species if nothing is done. The fight against climate change wont be won with just  technology and money, we have to change our way of thinking and our lifestyles.

<p>
The lecture "Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting" gives reasons why Ken's generation is not acting on climate change. Some reasons make sense, like how they did not experience the effects of climate change in most of their lifetime, however, others make no sense at all, like the part where boomers believe that scientists are corrupt and are trying to undermine democracy. That belief sounds like a conspiracy theory, it is so absurd that its actually funny that some people do believe this.
<br><br>


The climate change concern ranking was interesting to me. It was disheartening to see that older generations ranked climate change really low in their concerns list, lower than border patrol and immigration. This shows how selfish our country is, to put a global concern at the very bottom of the list while putting domestic problems on top. Although there is little concern when it comes to climate change, the fact that newer generations care more about climate change than the older generation gives the future regarding climate change a more hopeful outlook.

After watching “Why the generation that caused climate change is not acting”, it is evident that most of baby boomers, gen x, and Donald Trump's generation have very little concern about the climate crisis we are facing as a whole. As said by our professor, many of us are in a state of denial thats going to bring severe consequences to our environment if we do nothing. Many people blame it on the economy, on the sun, on a "natural" climate shift and many other things. This is most common in developing countries obviously because we are the ones benefiting from the burning of fossil fuels. I am ashamed of being part of a country who has had a 3.4% increase in CO2 release back into our atmosphere. this is ridiculous as it is completely selfish with no regards for non human life and the rest of the population worldwide. As stated in the video, the climate crisis isn't even in the top 10 of area of concerns by our government. It is ridiculous how other things like border security, military, immigration reforms, just to name a few, are on top of the climate crisis. There are very few people like our professor who is actually trying to do something to help better the CO2 emissions while the rest are living their lives relaxingly.

As I listened to Ken list some of the excuses that climate change deniers give when explaining why they think climate change isn’t true in “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting,” I found myself both amused and annoyed. I was amused at the effort that some people make in order to deny the subject of the climate crisis, but I was annoyed at the denials themselves. It made me wonder how some people would rather create and believe in conspiracies in order to push their own agendas and override those who are trying to alleviate the problems that Ken’s generation left behind.

This lecture video discussed the denial of older generations on climate crisis and how this mind set of theirs is contradicting that of the younger generation which is more aware of the climate crisis and is eager to make a change. Although one can understand that the older generations could not directly see the impact of their actions before, it is beginning to become more clear how much we continue to contribute to this crisis and simply choosing to ignore it seems like a very selfish act. The younger generation is now left struggling to try and find a way to fix the problem left, and it is not made easier by having those in power to encourage the change like the president and senate being in denial as well. 
<br><br>

One can go back and forth for years blaming each other for causing the problem of climate crisis; however, that is simply a waste of time and energy that can be put into trying to fix the problem. Regardless of what generation one is in, it is crucial to begin to make a change, the older generation clearly left us a problem and the majority clearly aren't attempting to help solve it, but this younger generation which is now more aware of the damage made shouldn't follow in the same footsteps. Although it might not be an easy or fast process any small progress can make a difference for future generations.

After watching this short lecture, I was really surprised to find out that the old generation who really caused the climate change started do not view it as a big treat. And those people who actually caused it are now holding the power in the office and they are continuing to refuse to accept the fact that we no longer live in a perfect place. However, the young generations just like us viewed it as a serious issue and put much more effort in preventing the potential catastrophes. We have to save our homeland before it is too late to take action. This is land that we all rely on and we can not afford to lose it.

I strongly agree with your opinions. Why do old generations care little about the climate change? I have thought this question for a long time, and later I had the answer: EDUCATION. Most people from that generations are lack of knowledge about climate crisis and global warming. They were receiving a lot of education of how to develop countries instead of taking care of the environment. Another problems mentioned in the video is that corruption within governments and scientists. I am really surprised that scientists will report false data due to corruption. Science is always our good teachers, and we will lose faith in science if corruption among scientists happen again. I am really glad to see that young generations like us are having more and more courses like Eng23. We can learn more about climate crisis and know what is happening to other countries. Ken mentioned a lot of countries  in the world that suffer a lot from global warming than developed countries. Many problems caused by climate change will make billions of people in the world homeless. I hope many officials can take more courses about the environment. It seems that they are still sleeping with their sweet dreams.

I agree with your comment. I think these older generations who think scientists are tricking the public are really pathetic, because they have done enough damage to the earth and they're still criticizing those scientists who are trying to fix the problem caused be them. It's so selfish for them to think of this issue disregarding the future of their own kids and grandkids, and their selfishness and arrogance have simply reminded me of reality that my generation should take more responsibility in this climate issue. Starting from doing small things in our lives, we all make a bigger impact.

Whether it's time delay, climate delay, suspecting scientists of being corrupt, or simply being ignorant to the evidence of the progressing climate change crisis– if this power generation doesn't realize that climate crisis is imminent then it makes recovery a serious problem. I am in shock that "70% of voters believe in human cause" but climate change is not a priority for most. That seems hypocritical in belief and behavior. Given that CO2 emission rose five times since the 2015 Paris Accords, proves that the power generation needs to act ASAP. Given that our student population's best mitigation to climate change is voting, makes me feel guilty of not being educated on things we vote for. Given, that a study revealed that the older you are, the less urgency you feel for climate change adds even more to the power generation needing to reform. Also, it makes me really upset that the three populations that do not contribute to CO2 emissions are feeling the consequences the most. We have a global, collective obligation to consider and realize the climate crisis is here and needs our attention.

The fact Ken presents that in 2015, when the Paris Accord was drafted, that global CO2 levels were rising by half a percent but in 2018, this increased to 2.7%; 5 times the 2015 amount. Hearing this I literally gaped. In this short time period, we managed to increase our release of CO2 in the atmosphere each year by five times. And this is a global average. The U.S. CO2 levels alone were rising 3.4% in 2018. These stats cannot be ignored, and it is tiring to hear that although this generation might be the most environmentally aware, little to nothing will get done on a global scale if people in congress are not forced to take action, if people in power are not forced to state the facts, and if people my age are sitting silently waiting for the answer to come. There is no time to sit and wait for an answer to the climate crisis to come, because we are in the midst of it. 
<br><Br>
What is more concerning is that despite all these facts there are still deniers of climate change. Personally, my dad is 40 and does not believe in climate change. We have discussions about it often and he believes that it is not anthropogenic and climate change is cyclical. While this is true I think this argument ignores the time frame of which all of this is happening. In this last few decades the global temperature and CO2 is rising faster than it ever has before, and faster than any other period of mass extinction. One of my high school teachers said before that a lot of misunderstanding about climate change is whether it is human caused or cyclical and I agree. This goes back to this gap where older people have not experienced or seen the effects of the climate crisis in their life so they do not believe that they have caused it to happen. To me I think this issue between deniers and environmentalists is so complex and it is important for young people to continue to act and educate their own families.

I agree very much with what you have said in your comment. I also feel the same way when it comes to the fact that this generation is the most environmentally aware in the history of human history but yet we still continue to have an increase in CO2 levels and emissions. I feel that most of us when we think of being environmentally friendly, we think about just recycling and material pollution such as trash in the oceans or streets but we don't actually think about our emissions of carbon in the atmosphere. We don't realize that us driving everywhere is causing great damage to our oceans as well as trash, or we don't think about how our eating habits contribute to deforestations which means less oxygen in the air and more carbon emissions along with it. I believe us as this new generation should try and have this understanding of being more environmentally friendly in being careful of how much we contribute to carbon emissions. Another point that you mentioned that I agree with is that we have to push and keep our government accountable for their part in this climate change also. We have to make sure that there are bills being passed that protect not only our environment but also the amount of carbon we release into the atmosphere and keep those big corporations accountable for how much they release into the air. We also have to educate not only the new generations but the old ones also, most of the old generation are the ones controlling our government and so we have to educate them on the consequences that have come from their actions.

The generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting because they are deny the the fact of climate crisis in many ways. Some of them deny that human caused the climate crisis, some deny its severity, and some even deny the climate crisis is really happening. There are so many excuses that they can make to deny everything about the climate crisis, but deep inside, they all know they are just make excuses for themselves to escape from taking any responsibilities. The developed countries emit the most portion of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but the developing countries are the ones who actualizing suffering from the consequences, which is sad. This is selfish. I do not want to and I do not have the right to blame it on anyone. Some of them foresee the consequences and they are trying their best to make progress and contribute to the climate crisis. The main problem that we should focus right now on is how to mitigate the climate crisis.

I think there could be a reason that the people/generation is not acting could be that some of them are trying to not admit and ignore the things that they have done, but they actually know the climate change is happening and it was caused by human beings. They were convinced by themselves; by some of those people’s pride---- the things they had done should not, and could not harm the earth this much. It might sound too blameful… but this is the stone-cold truth. Especially, even though tons and tons of scientists had claimed the climate crisis in front of many platforms those people are still and some of them may be still going to believe what they believe, just like what Ken said in the video. Those people may say that they lived their lives without seeing any huge impacts of burning fossil fuels. They have questioned so many people but themselves. I know that what we as the generation Z can only do small things to help, but the smaller things will save up to some big changes.

It is astonishing how big this addiction of fossil fuels the United States and other developed countries have and have continued to defend for its cheap price. This abuse on the use of nonrenewable resources have caused great consequences for young generations and those to come in future years. Consequences on actions that we had no say in but will be responsible for to solve. Yet many members who hold power in office or hold a great amount of influence are the same generation that made and continue to make decisions for a future they will not be around for. The age standards to hold office in government are the same generation. There is something completely wrong in the way politics clearly have not changed. The world is not the same as it was 50 years ago or even 1,000 years ago but it may be the same as 444, 375, 251, or 200 million years ago when the earth faced mass extinctions due to climate change. Our voice cannot be understood when we are generations apart and our message is regarded as a hoax and discredited.

The video on "Why the generation that caused the climate change is not acting" was very informative and effective in describing the generational issue on climate change. It has always been hard for me to see the generations my parents and grandparents came from, as what they are. My parents and grandparents are huge environmental activists and have been most of their lives, they gave me a good example of how we need to treat the earth. As I have been out in the world by myself, I can see that not many people are like my family. Most people are selfish, ignorant or in denial about the climate change. It is shocking to me how many encounters I have had with people ignorant about the environment. Politics do also take a huge part of public opinion on climate change. Since the past generation is so large, and many of them do vote it is hard to get climate change to a top priority. I think it is insane that our current president doesn't even believe climate change is a thing. The effect politicians can have on the public is too large for politicians to not be informed on climate change.

The video “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting” thoroughly explains why the older generation is not really concerned about the climate crisis. Not only have they not seen significant effects of carbon emissions, but the consequences wouldn’t really occur in their lifetime. They might doubt the reality or the severity of the climate crisis as they have not seen the environmental catastrophe that is yet to come.  The younger generation must take it upon themselves to educate their parents and grandparents about the consequences of climate change in order for them to make more environmentally conscious decisions.
<br><Br>
It is also reasonable human behavior to support self-interests. It is logical for someone of the older generation to care more about health care and social security as those are issues they’re going to face in their future. They might be more concerned about how they’re going to care for themselves when elderly and want to secure their future rather than a climate crisis that they won’t really be around for. Although I don’t think of this as an excuse, I understand the logic behind the majority of older generation’s behavior towards this topic. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has the right idea of implementing better social programs as a way to protect the environment.

Old people are low key weird. Ideas seem to be a lot like cacti: once you plant them, they grow some very deep roots. What I mean by this is similar to an "old dog new tricks" mindset. I believe the reason that many of the older generations are not willing to act upon a changing climate is because they are so firmly under the belief that it is in fact not occurring. Referencing things like "what climate change, it just snowed two feet!" or Trump's well worded quote "It's freezing! We need some global warming over here", we can see that the idea of climate change has not cracked through the incredibly dense shell that incases their minds. Climate change causes the climate to change. This does not mean that the change experienced will be additional heat, nor does it mean your town will freeze over. It simply means that things pertaining to the climate are, across the globe, changing at an alarming rate. This is hard to transmit into the minds of people who don't want to understand it on account of what I mentioned before: they have a "I don't believe you" cactus growing in their brain. They are busy thinking back on their lives and their youth, as well as thinking forward to the shorter remaining time they have left and thinking of the implications that could occur then. Naturally you wouldn't be scared of something if it wasn't coming for you, so they essentially have no reason to fear, and therefore no reason to think about the climate changing too much.

It's sad to see so many people keep their own comfort and safety in mind while they continue to blow it for the rest of us, and continue to hurt the already injured planet that we are supposed to be taking care of.

Throughout this lecture I generally thought “I’m disappointed, but not surprised”. This lecture reminded me that 75% of CO2 in the atmosphere came from the last six decades which, expectantly, encompasses the boomer generation. Obviously it’s hard to grasp that your entire generation has started a vast decline that could virtually wipe out the whole planet, but boomers frustratingly continue to deny what is happening, or displace blame. I cannot fault boomers for not initially understanding why fossil fuels are harmful, but when they turn away from the overwhelming evidence, a problem arises that should not be there to begin with. This issue shouldn’t even be politicized, but many boomers see climate change reform as stripping away their personal freedoms. Yet, if we continue on the path that we’re currently taking, it will take much more than a carbon tax and stricter emission laws to save us. Climate change is simply not a priority to older voters; the older the person, the less important it is. This is incredibly frustrating as someone who’s apart of generation z, as this is a priority for me and my peers. Like Professor Hiltner said, most of the people running the U.S government average between 60 to 70 years old, and when most of the people deny what I think is the largest issue facing our world, it is incredibly discouraging. Of course, we need to take action now, and while I am grateful to boomers who see climate change as a large threat to the world, I look forward to when the people of my generation rise up, and our society can become more progressive as a whole. I believe that we can stop the climate crisis from happening, and once the boomer generation leaves office, we can make sure it never happens again.

I feel like the main reason why Ken's generation does not act on this generation is because the worst consequences of climate change will not affect them because they will already be dead. I know that this may sound a little crude, but it is the facts. By the time that we see the worse of it it is very very unlikely that people from Ken's generation will be alive, and honestly it is very unlikely that most people in my generation will still be alive. Ken does mention his during this lecture and I completely agree with his point of view. However, from my point of view I believe that it is a little bit more difficult for Ken's generation to accept climate change because it was not something that they were born into, unlike my generation. As Ken mention 2/3 of carbon dioxide have been put into the atmosphere in his generation. Therefore the problem really began and drastically increased during their lifetime. In contrast, my generation was already born into the climate crisis. Our whole lives we have heard about global warming, emissions, saving turtles, and overall just being eco-friendly. For us this is the only life we know and fighting for a change is all we have been doing our whole lives. However, for Ken's generation this is new, therefore I see how it could be difficult to adjust and accept this concept, although it does not justify their lack of action in the matter.

Having been born in a developing country but growing up here in The United States has put me in an awkward place within the climate crisis. American ideals are a lot different than back in my country, although Western influence has undoubtedly crept its way in since the time I was born. Life moves a lot faster here and it seems that everything is about having more things, being more successful, but never quite being fulfilled. Additionally, it is strange and disheartening to see a society that is so out of touch with nature, which is not the case in many developing countries, where people are co-dependent of nature. This is especially true of Ken's generation and the one before it, who was heavily pressured by the idealistic American Dream. While taking English 22 last quarter, I often wrote about thinking that humans are selfish by nature and there was no stopping the inevitable exploitation of resources. However, after recently reflecting on life. In my home country and countries similar to it, it is clear to me that there are masses of people deeply connected with the environment, looking after it, using its resources but not exploiting, always giving back. It is heartbreaking to think that these people will bear the biggest burdens of climate change. 
<br><Br>

I hope that this is the attitude new generations here and in other developed countries will be raised with. It will take an entirely new way of life to begin relieving the climate crisis, which unfortunately doesn’t seem like a priority to the older generations. It is inspiring that so many young people have taken action in combatting the climate crisis but unfortunate that those in power have not done the same. The fact that it took an entirely new generation, who have experienced the effects of climate change in its epitome, to begin making a change is shocking and disappointing. The future lies in the hands of our youth.

<p>
My main take away from the lecture video is that the generation that caused the climate crisis essentially doesn’t see the fault in their actions. Boomers care more about what happens at the border rather than something that will affect the entire world. I believe many people from the older generation tend to get swayed by ridiculous conspiracies such as those that say scientists are corrupt which is why the are warning of climate change. 
<br><Br>


The older generation is not only impacting the west, their viewpoints are holding the entire world back from change. People in countries who did so little will feel the most impact from our choices. I wish that the transition of power would be easier. Even though many 25-35 year olds would be perfectly eligible to run in an election and win, the American political system holds them back. American politics have traditionally and to this day consists mainly of old white men so it is very hard for others to break these barriers. However, I wish that we can see more change in our congress and the mentalities of the American people.

I agree with what you said in terms of the American political system holding people back, and overall the hope that the American mentality would change.
<br><br>
It’s a fact that has been repeated in the class before and yet, as anyone would, I still find it so upsetting that the poorest parts of the world are going to suffer from the climate crisis when they haven’t done anything. In this lecture when Professor Hiltner brings up several theories as to why some people don’t believe in the climate crisis, and one of them a theory about corrupt scientists and the government, I thought it was so laughable. At the same time, I can see why older generations would believe that. It’s almost like the saying “ignorance is bliss” but in this case, it’s a selfish kind of bliss rooted in the desire to maintain the American lifestyle of time’s past. Instead of thinking how “corrupt” scientists possibly are when it comes to climate change, people should be focusing on facts already present, like which companies are contributing to the extraction of fossil fuels and such. I was also really shocked at how quickly CO2 was rising from 2015 to 2018.


<br><hr>
I took the same thing from the lecture and although a vast majority of people blame the Boomer generation, I think there are people who have resources that are trying to help. I am currently taking a seminar in which Kinari Webb, a doctor and founder Health in Harmony, went to different countries and asked what one of the major things they needed and about every places said healthcare. The reason this correlates is because in most of these countries, people would log about 60 trees in order to get one person healthcare. With this, I am trying say that some people are doing what they can to help. Unfortunately not enough people that are blamed for the crisis are doing anything. 

<br><br>

Hiltner mentioned that the older people are, the less they'll care about the climate crisis or even acknowledge it and I believe that is because they do not see the point to do anything about it since they will not live to see the worst of the situation. It is hard to believe that before climate crisis was first brought about, hardly anybody believed the world would not have the potential to end up the way may. Also, nothing irks me more than people denying the cause of climate change or the lack of trying to help the world to better it for the people who are going to be affected by it. Especially for underdeveloped countries who lack the resources, and caused the least amount of problems.

In this lecture Ken mentioned that we need to fundamentally rethink and act on the way our species interacts with the climate. I took an environmental ethics class last quarter and this point relates alot to the ethical debates we discussed: what is humans relationship to the earth and its ecosystems. And I have come to learn for me that morality does not involve humans dominating the earth and conquering it for our benefit but that we must live alongside an in harmony with Earth, otherwise because of things like climate change our species will not survive. WE are driving ourselves to a catastrophe because of that thought that we need to use nature to get what we want out of it. 
<br><br>
 I like that Professor Hitlner also pointed out the the people suffering the most are not the ones who benefited. It is such a sad statistic that the poorest 3 billion people who contributed less than 5% to the climate crisis will easily be impacted the harshest, while the developed countries who contributed 2/3rds and more to this crisis benefited from the burning of fossil fuels. That’s why I believe it is the developed countries job to lead the way and aid developing countries into transitioning to renewable energy. 
<br><br>
 I really like the point professor made about the polls showing how not a priority global warming is to the older generations. I would think, because in my mind it is, that climate change would be the number one most important issue, at worst top 3, but it is 18th or even higher as you get older! The generation that is our President’s age ranks it 23 out of 29, how insane is that. So we have to understand today that it is not that people are blatantly denying anthropogenic climate change in strong numbers, it's that it is not a high priority for a high number of people in power. 
<br><br>
 I think one great solution is we need to get young people to vote. The older generations (65 and up) should not have twice the number of people in that age group voting as the younger people. A way to get politicians to care about this issue that is the number one issue humanity faces is vote! This is why I volunteer at CALPIRG and want to help out the New Voters project! It helps young people understand the importance of voting and I want to frame it in terms of climate change. Overall this video was fantastic and informative.

I find it extremely interesting that you mentioned your environmental ethics class in this response, because it is extremely relevant to Ken's argument in this video. As you mentioned, it is becoming evident that humans need to change their lifestyle and live in harmony with the Earth if we want a bright future without the consequences of our actions as a human race. However, the issue with this style of living is the fact large capitalist corporations will loose profit in attempts to become environmentally friendly and the power that these corporations have can push back the political agenda years to where the damage done to the environment could very well be irreversible. This is the sad reality of America's political climate in the sense is how the majority can be easily influenced and overridden by the richer minority. Furthermore, as discussed in your comment, the younger generation has a large role to play in the climate crisis conversation and can politically help convince the older generation of the danger climate change presents to the planet. 
<br><br>

In terms of the older generations mindset, it is important to note that they did not grow up with the term "climate change" being thrown around media and creating this concern from literally as far as I can remember. For example, growing up I was always concerned with the melting of the ice caps and the polar bears which were affected by the loss of their habitat. If I as a kid, could comprehend the dangers of global warming then I find it really concerning that the older generations cannot grasp such a simple concept. This concept being: Human beings through the production of greenhouse gases found in the oil, coal, and meat industries are killing the planet. Period. Furthermore, I don't believe the problem at hand with the older generation is incompetence but moreover ignorance seeing as they have lived a majority of their life one way, and accepting the truth would require them to reconsider their lifestyle habits.

The lecture video, "Why the generation the caused climate change is not acting" presents a great point about the older generation being in denial. I have told many of my friends about this class and almost all of their immediate reactions are to say, "Well the climate crisis is not the biggest issue or world has to face right now." or "Your information is probably biased because you go to a school like UCSB." And sure, they are allowed to have their own opinions or to argue their points, but I personally agree with what was said in their video and has been discussed in this class so far. My conversations with my doubtful friends also support Ken's statement about the majority of denial towards the climate crisis coming for the developed world. We think we know so much about this topic because we live in America or because of the information we get from the news or from politicians. Returning to the older generation being most susceptible to denial, I think it is very important to understand that the majority of our government are members of this generation. This video points this out and makes clear that more times than none, these people are against environmental policy or action to fight the climate crisis.

After watching the lecture video "Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting" I'm amazed at how the older generation is easily able to ignore the fact that the climate is changing. It would be unfair to group an entire generation as we know people like Ken have actually tried to do something about it. It's also really concerning to hear that our government is run by primarily people over the age of 60. These are the people who are responsible for creating laws to help combat climate change and yet they do not believe it's been cause by human action. It's also incredibly frustrating to see that gen x is the generation that cares the most about the  climate crisis and yet we have no real government positions and government officials that refuse to make any real change.

It is truly infuriating that the majority of people who are in charge are the same people who deny the issue of climate change and who say that the issue is not concerning. It makes my generation and I appear to be voiceless and often labeled as children who do not know how the world works. What we do know is that the climate is changing and that if we don’t do anything about it there will be no resolution in the other problems that the US government has.
<br><br>
Younger generations also tend to vote less which makes the issue more infuriating, the people who are in charge are only in charge because of the people who vote them in office. If younger people started to vote more, there would be more environmental reform given that this generation was raised in a world where the severity of climate change is constantly ingrained into our minds whether it be through the media or the news. Ultimately, it feels very exhausting that the issue of climate change is often pushed onto us which makes it feel extremely alarming considering that well be alive when the rest of the world who put the earth in a wreck will not be living in the harsh conditions created by them .

I found "Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting" to be an entertaining and informative video about the past six decades of the climate crisis. The concern rankings were frustrating like many others who have commented on this video have previously stated. However, is this really all that surprising? The generations above us are worried about the current state of our country and it is the way they were raised to try to better things such as our borders or our economy. I am not absolving Ken's generation of dramatically increasing the climate crisis, but I do believe the lack of awareness and support of the climate change discussion led to this confusion about what was actually taking place on Earth. I believe that the discussion our current generation is pushing out into the world about the severity of this topic is encouraging. Due to a lack of the generations before us to act, especially top political figures, I do not see any major progress in out future until the people in power are more well informed and less selfish. This may sounds pessimistic, but I do believe change will not occur unless positions that hold significant power are held by people who truly want to spark environmentally positive changes. For this reason I think it is only a matter of time until this happens, but unfortunately as we have learned and heard in this video we are running out of time.

Through this lecture video it became clear to me the mentality of the "Baby Boomer" generation and the generations previous; They are selfish. The poll done demonstrated that they care the least about global warming and would rather focus attention on immigration, social security, the economy, and healthcare. They care only because these issues will impact the remainder of their lives. They continue to want to live without consequences to their actions. What they do not seem to realize is the future generations will not even have the privilege on living a stable seniority. Future generations will continue to live in a never ending cycle of survival if we do not take action now. This is not the time to deny that the climate crisis is occurring-it is the time to band together as the human race in order to create a change.
<br><br>


It was very frustrating seeing the lengths that the "Baby Boomer" generation would go through to "debunk" climate change. They would rather partake in fallacies in order to soothe their minds, rather than taking action that would actually result in a positive impact. They are questioning the wrong people in terms of intentions. They prefer to question the scientists that are doing us a favor by being completely transparent on the issue in order to help stimulate a global chain reaction to fight for our Earth, instead of the fossil fuel corporations. This mindset has left future generations extremely vulnerable. We are expected to adopt the skills and attitude that generations before us could not even muster.

I am in 100% agreement with you. The fact 70% of voters agree that climate change is a current issue brought about by humans and that it ranks so low in the polls of Baby Boomers and Gen X is infuriating. They continue their selfish ways until death. These issues that they rank as the most most important are no where even near the importance of climate change. None of those issues can cause the end of all life as we know it.  As you said, the issues they choose to care about only relate to them. They have been the sole reason to why our world is as bad as shape as it is and can seem to careless. They should be the group of people trying to help the most after all they did make this mess it's only right for them to clean it up.
<br><br>


In our societies we are always told that our elders are the wisest. When it come to climate change that couldn't be further form the truth. If our elders were wise they would realize how damaged our planet is and realize how damaged it will be  in the near future. The younger generation has so much burden left upon us, burden created by our parents and grandparents. It's all who have contributed the least who are going to suffer the most. The youth, the poor, and animals who have made little impact compared to Baby Boomers and Gen X. It is almost as if those who are supposed to be most wise are most ignorant during a time of action.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with what you’re saying. I find it extremely sad to see various adults choosing to believe that climate change isn’t real for selfish reasons. Choosing to put their focus on other less important things is frightening. Choosing to overlook this serious issue that a majority of them caused because it will most likely not affect them in their lifetime is actually the saddest part. Because of their lack of effort, future generations will have to suffer the consequences of their ignorant actions. I agree with you when you state how sad it is that they’re questioning scientists who are trying to help instead of the coal companies polluting the air we breathe. The fact that economic status is more important than saving the planet that gives them life says so much about their morals. I hope that younger generations will learn from their mistakes and choose to walk down a different path than they did.

In the video “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting” I believe that it truly gives context to the main reasons as to why some people do not believe in climate change. It may just be because they do not want to believe it. If they admit that climate change is real and that we do contribute a lot to the change, that would mean that they have been wrong on the subject for years and that they themselves may indeed, be the villains. Admitting that you’re wrong about something can be a hard pill to swallow but now that the evidence is insurmountable about how something is really happening and that it will only get worse from here on out. It does not matter if you believe in the climate crisis or not, it is obvious that the world is changing and not for the better. People should stop debating whether or not it exists and instead be working to actually fix the problem.

<p>
It is genuinely shocking to me that climate deniers would rather formulate irrational conspiracy theories about scientists' agendas than accept the reality of our changing climate. If climate scientists truly were being paid to falsify their findings in the name of political gain, then why wouldn't this be the case with other types of scientists, such as chemists, doctors, or physicists (and other widely accepted forms of science)? Climate deniers seem to be under the impression that their personal experiences hold more value than factual evidence, even though it is staring right in their faces.  

<br><br>

I appreciated how you identify that the issue of climate change is becoming more prominent within more recent generations. Many wonder why no action is being taken by politicians or corporate leaders, but since their average age is about 65 years old, they choose not to act because they do not believe in it. This does give us a glimmer of hope, however: in the coming decades, these positions will be filled by individuals of our generation (who truly believe in climate change), and those individuals will actually be motivated to take action. Let's just hope that it's not too late by the time that happens.
<br><br>


You mentioned that many deniers claim that they have not seen any evidence of climate change within their lifetimes. A major reason behind this is something called the "shifting baseline effect." This illustrates how global environmental conditions are slowly becoming worse over time, but each generation accepts this as their norm. Thus, they have nothing to compare their current conditions to, while they would fail to meet the climate conditions that previous generations had thrived in.

It's difficult to express the sheer amount of frustration I feel towards Ken's generation, not his entire generation more so those who are in positions of power. It is absolutely infuriating to know that fossil fuel companies literally KNEW that extracting oil would have devastating effects on our environment and they purposely omitted that information from the public. Here we are a couple decades later trying to figure out how to fix the immense problem THEY created and continue to exacerbate. Frankly, I think about it all the time--our political system is all kinds of messed up and it's what got us here in the first place. These fossil fuel companies have so much power and wreak havoc everywhere. They funnel millions upon millions of dollars into the pockets of politicians and politicians who are supposed to be representing US would rather have money and live luxuriously rather than actually grow a pair and represent the interests of the people who got them their position in the first place. Fossil fuel money (or any corporate interest money) should have absolutely no place in politics. The government is supposed to represent and fight for the interests of their constituents--people who are struggling to make ends meet, who can't afford their medical bills, struggle to find jobs, don't have access to clean air or water, who face food insecurity and who face all these sorts injustices and others--not the interests of the wealthy, greedy 1% who care only about maintaining their wealth. It's absolutely ridiculous that the 1% of Ken's generation who put us here still continues to worsen our current global state and now my generation is facing the consequences and has to fix the problem. I didn't ask to have to take on the world's problems. I didn't ask to have to be anxious everyday about the worsening state of our environment and world around us. None of us did. None of us should have to take on this immense and growing crisis. And yet here we are trying to fix the problems of a generation who had no regard to the consequences of their business.

Preach. The level of greed is astonishing to me and makes me so angry on the daily. I don't understand how people can knowingly have children and families and still accept donations from companies who are major contributors to climate change. Do you not care about your kids? Are you not worried about them being involved in a catastrophic natural disaster that has been accelerated by climate change? They aren't. All they are worried about is their paychecks and their houses and their money. I am so angry that people that have the power to change the world are the ones that are most corrupt, and I'm angry that I don't even want to have kids because I don't want them growing up in a post-apocalyptic world. People are so selfish.

I'm sorry but I LITERALLY don't understand how someone can just be in a "deep deep denial." Yes, I understand this is a difficult thing to come to terms with, but as more and more research is done and climate catastrophes are happening it seems impossible to ignore! Actually as I am writing this I am picturing some of our presidents tweets, and can see how somebody might cling to his words as a form of reassurance--If he is saying it then it must be true. New Climate Action Plan: Dump Trump. Do they majority of americans believe in climate change? You have said 70% of americans believe climate change is cause by humans. I know that I am in the younger generation, but to me it seems like the majority does and the minority does not. This makes me wonder how such a small group of people (in the oil industry, politicians, etc.) seem to be dominating the conversation?? This is a democracy so why is the every day person not voting for climate conscious policies?

"Dump Trump" is quite amusing. It's still a bit sad that these two words can show just how political this issue has become. Changing to a more environmentally-friendly president would be a great way to help solve the crisis. Yet, even if we 'dumped' Trump, there wouldn't be much change unless there was a majority of non-deniers in the U.S. government. Al Gore was literally vice president, but I feel that most people don't even notice the effects of having an environmentalist as vice president. 
<br><br>
Of course, the move towards a government with less climate deniers is extremely important and powerful, as seen in the example given in the video. It's important for the younger generation to step up because we're more likely to realize that climate change is here. I feel that an important reason why Ken keeps reminding us to act is because it's easier to replace skeptical politicians with aware politicans (and younger politicians are more likely to care) than to convert skeptics into believers and activists. Many people have been taught that hypotheses  and theories are never actually proven true and can only be proven false. Activists can shove evidence that anthropogenic climate change exists into the faces of skeptics, but, according to how Western science works, it still won't be proven true. Deniers and skeptics have an advantage in that proving something wrong is easier, which also makes it easier to mislead others. If you prove anthropogenic climate change is false, then that's it. Despite all the evidence proving that it exists, if you can prove it's false, then it's false to most people. It's really easy to trick people into believing climate change is false, despite how false beliefs can easily be refuted  by someone who is aware.
<br><br>
I'd like to note that Trump isn't the first, and possibly not the last, president to be a climate denier or ignorant about the climate crisis. I remembered that Reagan's attitude towards enivironmentalism wasn't that great, so I googled to check, and I found, from various websites, an interesting quote from him: "Trees cause more pollution than automobiles do." To put it simply, that sentence sounds as dumb as what some of the stuff Trump says about the environment. It's also similar in that it might seem true to those who lack knowledge about climate change, but won't withstand deeper scrutiny. Similar tactics to mislead or persuade people have been used throughout the decades.

The title of this video threw a question to the audience, "why the generation that caused climate crisis is not acting?" So why? My understand to who actually caused today's climate crisis after making reflections from those lectures. As what Ken has been saying , It's his generation. Ken mentioned that his generation was actually causing the 3/4 carbon dioxide emissions of today. I can totally understand that's the results of improving industry, making money(the economy). I want to mention that people like scientists or business people might not have a comprehensive understandings or they might not even know how much damage they will bring to our earth when they were wanting to promote the industrial development. I want to connect some points from the reading sources "why scientists disagree with global warming". As what the text writes to us, "climate is an interdisciplinary subject" which means it needs those scientists to work and research, and finally combined their ideas from different fields. However, that wouldn't happen in Ken's generation.
<br><br>
Then let's talk about us. I am glad to realize myself is raising my own consciousness on climate crisis and my small steps to put effort in saving the planet we rely on. Honestly we all know why my generation now has higher consciousness on protecting the climate and saving our earth is because we are witnessing uncountable disasters the past generations had brought to the planet. Now we are experiencing all the results and punishments. If not now, then when? I am both sad and mad when seeing the old generation keep acting what they are used to do and care nothing about climate crisis. I feel so sorry when I see the data shows that the poor countries in the world are now experiencing drought, the deprivation of food, and etc. We clearly know those people have done nothing but they are now "taking the punishments for us". I know that will happen on us in the near future if we don't make actions. We should now not only raise our awareness on climate issues but also put efforts into it like changing our lifestyle.

While watching this video I found the chart about ranking the importance of a problem per generation really interesting. It demonstrated that the older generations do not find climate change a pressing issue. This was very frustrating to me because these older generations have largely contributed to CO2 admissions and not only let it continually increase at a fast rate without concern and still do not find it concerning enough to this day. This seems selfish like they don't care what happens to future generations. With that said, I think after discussing that these older generations didn't have to see the effects of climate change right away changed their response. Now that we are in 2020 there is no excuse considering we are all seeing the effects. While the older generations won't live to see the worst of it I still find it very aggravating that many of them don't make climate change a higher priority, after all, they are and were major contributors. Overall, no matter what generation you are in, I think it is time that we all make it a high priority.

I also found the chart that showed the ranking the importance of a problem per generation really interesting. The chart really helped show how the generations above us were and may still be at least partly in denial about the climate crisis. I agree this is very frustrating. It is unfair to us and future generations because they did put most of the CO2 into the atmosphere. However, I can understand why how they did so much damage without realizing it was a problem. Because of the time delay they never saw any direct effects of their actions. If I'm being completely honest I think we as a generation would have done the same. In addition to this we as a generation are following in their footsteps and helping to continue rapidly pumping C02 into the atmosphere. They might have made a mistake but we are continuing to make the same mistakes as them. We need to make a change. As Ken said the way we make this change is by voting. The older generations are still in control over congress and they still possess so much power. This is problematic because they have created a society and culture that is built on frequent consumption and the burning of fossil fuels. in order to take control and make a change for our future generations we need to vote and change the current politics that support the climate crisis.

This lecture video brings up one of the most frustrating parts about the climate crisis, people's denial of the issue and their unwillingness to act. Three quarters of all Co2 in the atmosphere was put there in the last 60 years by the developed world. The older generations have been unwilling to accept the legitimacy of the crisis and instead latch on to unsupported claims and their denial. It seems that people will use any excuse to escape blame for how their actions may have contributed to the problem. Many in older generations haven't seen the lasting impact of their CO2 emissions and cling to their denial so that they do not have to change their lifestyle. Since its these older generations in power it's very difficult for the proper changes to be made and steps to be taken in order to have a successful intervention. It will most likely be our generation who is forced to act and stand up against the climate crisis.

I was honestly astounded when Ken said that, on a poll asking which issues facing us today are considered most important, older generations were ranking climate change as low as #18 to #23 out of 29, prioritizing instead topics like social security, border control, and immigration. Maybe it's because they're older and already past the halfway point in their lives, but I truly can't understand how these people can avert their attention from an issue that will impact generations to come and instead focus only on the issues that they think will have an immediate effect on their daily lives.
<br><br>

For the younger generation, it seems nearly impossible to ignore this issue. With the majority of our lives a big question mark ahead of us, we see that climate change will not only heavily affect our future but is already affecting our present. I'd be interested to know what millennials and gen Z-ers answered in response to this poll, as I think that for many of us, we believe climate change is the #1 issue facing our generation.

I thought that the “Concern Ranking” graph did an effective job of summarizing the importance of climate change to each generation. The graph shows that for Ken’s generation, global warming was 18th out of 24 issues. Instead higher priority was placed on the economy, terrorism, immigration reform, and border security. This outlines a deeper issues – the graph shows that issues that are highly relevant in mainstream media translate accordingly to the concern ranking. This also shows that if more important is placed on climate change through mainstream media, it may lead to a rise in climate change concern for generations like Ken’s. It is important that concern regarding climate change is emphasized across all generations, as it is an issue that needs as much help as it can get. 
<br><br>
Ken also does a good job of identifying the three major groups that are most impacted by climate change and that should be the most upset: half of the world’s population that has minimally accounted for the rise of CO2 levels in the atmosphere but will suffer the most from it, non-human life on earth who hold zero responsibility, and the children of previous generation who supposedly caused this crisis. It is very sad that the majority of people and life who will be most heavily effected by the climate crisis will  be the ones that did the least to cause it. As a result, it is also angers me that the generations that did cause it, are the ones that show least concern about it.

The “Concern Ranking” chart also helped me visualize the gender gap regarding climate change. I agree that an increased presence in mainstream media will give more urgency to the climate crisis, both by spreading awareness and by growing the environmental ‘bandwagon.’ However, I believe that it is important to address the potential factors that contribute to the apathy older generations feel about climate change. Firstly, it is easy to deny an issue when one is sheltered from its impacts, especially when many of the people who contributed most to the issue are living in the developed world. Secondly, climate change is not portrayed as an enemy, but rather an ambiguous threat. Many of the other issues that boomers ranked more important, such as immigration and terrorism, have been promoted with nationalistic rhetoric as the US being ‘against’ a common perceived ‘enemy.’ These tactics are effective in getting people to engage with an issue, but climate change is not usually portrayed using this strategy which therefore contributes to its low priority.

The inaction of the generation's that came before mine can only be explained by selfishness. As Ken has explained, people were aware of the climate crisis and of the damage that they were doing to the planet yet continued to do so for the sake of financial gain. With the age trends of government officials that was presented in Ken's video, "Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting," it is clear that younger people need to become more active in politics, even if it just means voting, in order to ensure that those who lead our nation take the climate crisis seriously.

Imperialism is terrible. It's what has caused the poor to be poorer, those who suffer to suffer more, just because those who imperialize just take and take and take. This is happening at a global level now, countries like the US who are literally digging into the earth and taking its resources for its own benefit and profit are harming everyone else and the effects can be seen more intensely in countries that have a higher poverty rate. Is this what environmental imperialism looks like? We as US consumers have benefited from the fossil fuel economy. We benefit from a system that is destroying the lives of others in our own communities like Oxnard and Ventura and other countries like India and countries in Latin America. 
<br><br>

Seeing the graph of how quickly the co2 emissions made me want to get up and physically stop fracking equipment from pulling oil from the ground. Like many protesters chain themselves to trees or buildings they don’t want to be demolished, I wanted to go out and physically stop the machines from pulling oil. 
<br><br>

Yes, personal changes like biking not eating meat will have a positive effect but we need to hold companies and corporations who have caused this situation to rapidly escalate accountable; we, the ones who have benefited from the fossil fuel industry, are the ones who must stop them. We have to kick out politicians who support these corporations and replace them with people who do not receive money from these groups and that will take effective steps to reverse the climate crisis. Like Ken said, We. Have. To. Vote. if we are able to, and if we are not, then we have to encourage those who can vote to actually go out to the polls. We know what we have to do we just have to get the people in power to stop being selfish money hogs, and listen and act on the cries of the people.

In the video “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting”, Ken provides an explanation for why most people from his generation are not acting to deal with the climate crisis. Firstly, people in his generation released a massive amount of CO2 into the atmosphere without feeling the impacts of it. This unusual time delay in part makes people ignore climate change. People think it is not a problem to burn fossil fuels and totally ignore scientists’ warnings. I think another reason why people are not acting to the climate crisis is they don’t have the courage to face this crucial issue. Therefore, they try to persuade themselves that maybe those scientific researches are wrong, maybe it’s just the natural cycles, or maybe it’s just nothing about human actions. There is only part of the population that holds the most responsibility for producing CO2, but everyone including animals and children on this planet has to suffer from the consequences of climate change. As Ken said, his generation is still largely in power across the planet, so I hope they could realize the severity of climate change as soon as possible and utilize their ability and power to mitigate the climate crisis.
<br><br>
In the next video “What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis”, Ken suggests some radical solutions to the next generation which is our generation. Ken suggests that we need to take control of this planet and act now by using a nonviolent way. One of the simplest, quickest, and most effective things we can do is to vote and to urge our friends to vote in order to get partial political power. Even if we are not succeeding in taking control of this planet, we can at least have a profound influence on the older generations. Our last generations already made the biggest mistake, so we need to and have to act now to avert the worst consequences.

Before watching this lecture I was already aware that there are many people out there who believe that climate change is not anthropogenic. However, I didn’t realize that this thought is very much common among the older generations. It is amazing that the majority of older people refuse to admit that climate change exists even when they are given statistical evidence that says otherwise. It is more than borderline ridiculous to assume that trained professionals, people who dedicate their entire lives to science, are wrong. Yes, it is definitely a possibility that an individual may be wrong, but when it is an entire community of professionals that agree on the same subject it is highly unlikely that they are incorrect. You would think that much of the older generations would feel some level of empathy for the situation they have brought upon us, especially since their own children and grandchildren have been left to deal with their mess. It’s become very clear that the youth must take action and stop leaving everything to the older generations. They obviously don’t care as much because they won’t be here for the long run.
 <br><br>

I do however realize that not all are to blame, for the few like Ken are empowering the youth and are striving to make a change, even if the severe consequences of the climate crisis will not become evident until after their lifetime. Although the older generations do come across as selfish, I still respect those who take responsibility for their actions and carry their message on to the next generation.

I agree completely with you, while the time delay may be a significant factor in the occurrence of the climate crisis, the principal cause behind it is the blatant disregard the past generations have had towards the climate crisis. The Earth is around 4.5 billion years old, and yet 3/4 of all the CO2 was put into the atmosphere is merely 60 years. That means that 3/4 of all CO2 was put into the atmosphere in 0.00000133333% of its existence. I cannot even fathom how all of this happened in merely 6 decades!! The worst part of all of this is that I still hear people saying the same phrases: "After all, I've lived all my life without seeing the consequences of fossil fuels", "Whose to say that they are caused by human action", "It's just the natural cycle of the world". I think it is essential, even should become mandatory that all students, whether it be high school or college, should take a class like English 23. If we can ensure that the youth is informed, educated and ready to act, then we can ensure that history will not repeat itself with the older generation. As Ken stated in the video "What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis", we need to fundamentally reinvent Western culture, especially consumer culture and the belief that happiness is to be found in the things we have. The best way to conspicuously alter our culture is to educate the youth and change societal expectations and societal norms. 
 <br><br>

Despite my optimism that our generation will essentially be the superheroes in the story of the earth, I also fear that the current generation in power will commit far too many crimes against the earth, to the point where it is no longer salvageable. The average ages Ken recalled that are in office, controlling our private markets and our country as a whole, is simply frightening. We always learned in business that employing new staff from perhaps different countries, different ages, and different backgrounds is extremely beneficial for the company because it allows the utilization of new skills, alternate ideas, and fresh perspectives. That is what I think the power in this country lacks, intergenerational diversity.

<p>
I was surprised to see how low climate change was ranked on the list of priorities for our country. I thought it was a growing issue amongst all generations, but Ken brought to our attention that our generation is actually being impacted the most and cares more than the older generations. Possibly because they believe they will not see the effects of climate change in their lifetime, and therefore rather be selfish and focus on issues that they will see through to the end. Considering the big spokespeople for climate change include Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio belonging to the Gen X and baby boomer generations, I thought older generations would listen to them and take them seriously rather than a young spokesman from my generation. On the contrary, people from Ken's generation and older are denying climate change in ridiculous ways. I found the theory about the scientists being swayed by money to be the most ridiculous theory of them all. I think the statistic is 97% of all scientists agree that climate change is happening and human induced. It makes me angry that our elected officials and leader of our nation are not using their power to tackle this issue. Pulling out of the Paris Agreement is about the most selfish act we have done as a country. However, what upsets me the most is the fact that our developed nation won't even see the worst effects. The poorest nations will be the ones who take the biggest hit due to our selfish acts of development.  It is important with the 2020 election coming up that we use our vote to voice our opinions on fighting not just for what's right for our country but what is right for the fate of the planet.

I really appreciate when Professor Hiltner apologizes for his generation because I try not to ignore my generation’s contribution and responsibility as I think we are also affect the problem, but Professor Hiltner underscored how my generation appears to be the one that cares the most. I always thought we were just aware of climate change from a young age because we were the ones told the most about it when in fact scientists have been alerting both public officials and policy makers even before Professor Hiltner’s time. I thought it was very relatable to how society functions when he was describing how instead of accepting the conclusions of scientists and their conclusions regarding the climate crisis, many turn to maybes and theories to remain in denial… An example being Donald Trump who rather push forward the agenda that the climate crisis is a hoax and misinforming his supporters / the public for his own benefit. And to what extent will he indulge in this benefit if global warming ruins it for him?
 <br><br>

I agree with Professor Hiltner when he discusses groups who should be profoundly upset, such as the half of the world’s population who has had minimal contribution yet suffers the consequences arguably worse due to their lack of advancement, the non-humans who hold no responsibility yet endure the CO2 rise painfully, and the future generations who may largely benefit from the fossil fuel reliant economy but also suffer from it. It is the responsibility of the Baby Boomers and Generation Z. Baby Boomers see the climate crisis as the 18 out of 29 important subjects of concern and worry more about terrorism, immigration reform, border security, and such areas that are more human against human. Generation X is more concerned, 15 out of 29, more care for a cause where humans need to unite and go against the consequences of relying on fossil fuels.  Despite having large support from Gen Z, we still need Baby Boomers in on this because they make up most of our government today. It is the duty of my generation to not only advance eco-friendly technology but use our voices to speak on the behalf of groups such as the poorer countries, our animals, and our children and children’s children against non-believers and in hopes of converting them and swaying the hearts of those in power to take action, such as Baby Boomers in Congress, in order for more aid towards cleaning up this mess for the better.

This self-flagellation and dramatic display of self-pity is as counter-productive as the hated generation's passivity,
 <br><br>

I accept any apology coming from the "boomer" generation because I do not wish to succumb to a frenzy of blame vis-à-vis my forefathers. Yes, I am aware that the "boomer" generation has made mistakes, I am not denying that. Every generation makes mistakes just like every generation has its qualities. I do not blame that generation; many were born in times of increasing peace and prosperity, raised by parents who experienced true horrors of global warfare and institutionalized murder (e.g. the Holocaust). That generation vicariously experienced the trauma of their parents and indulged in the exciting newfound pleasures of modern consumerist life. Would we have done the same? Yes, I am sure we would have indulged in that lifestyle too. I sense a lack of humility in this generation, a nefarious sense of superiority in our mockeries. We are also an imperfect generation, trapped between blissful comfort and the dramatic reality of climate change. 
 <br><br>

So let's put our differences aside.

<p>
We should not be facing the failures of the prior generations, and yet, here we are. Although their constant excuse is “we could not foresee the consequences”, did they think that emitting unspeakable amounts of the known perpetrator of our demise would not do anything? Did they believe that it would disinegrate into nothing, or did they just not care? I believe that the majority believed in the latter, and it is obvious (and proven, as the polls found) that they still do today. Our culture believes in ‘looking at what is right in front of us’, but when what is right in front of us comes sixty years later, it is hard to decipher whether or not they should be held accountable. It is also hard to believe that the death of our planet started only 60 years ago, and yet so much has happened during this time that we constantly push away from because we know we are the ones who caused it. Most thought that in 2020, we would be living in homes in the sky, driving flying cars, or be overrun by robots– but the reality is, we are reliving our past. Racism is still effervescently present, women are still pushed over by men, and global warming is still as real as possible. We are reliving through the consequences of our past, and it is hard to be optimistic when nobody is there to save it.

In this first lecture video, Ken discusses the reasons why the generation that largely caused the climate crisis is not doing anything to help solve it. The main point is that older generations, such as the Baby Boomers, do not see climate change as a big issue, or they don’t see it as a problem at all. Denial might be the strongest reason behind this reasoning. It is a lot to take on that due to your actions, the planet is headed towards becoming unlivable. Many older people just tell themselves that they didn’t do anything wrong and the people that are saying that climate change is real and urgent are just being irrational. While living in California, where most people are very climate-conscious, I feel like I rarely interact with anyone who is a climate change denier, but sadly there is a large portion of the country that is a denier or at least doesn’t see it as an issue. A Ken pointed out, in a poll of important issues in the US, the baby boomer generation ranked climate change as #18, putting issues like social security and the military as more important. I believe that a major reason why this generation doesn’t see climate change as an urgent issue is that they know they will most likely be dead before the impacts of climate change. The younger generation, however, knows that without action, human-caused climate change will largely impact the rest of our lives. It is difficult for us younger people who want change because the average age of congresspeople, supreme court judges, and basically all people in government is 50s-70s. This is why the younger generation has to act fast to start electing people who see our concern and will help to enact change.



</p><hr>


<p>
In Ken’s lecture video he explains the horrors of climate change and what the older generation has done to cause that. He speaks of the time delay between actions and us seeing the results, which can explain why many people from older generations do not see climate change as a major issue. Younger generations, on the other hand, will have to face these delayed consequences in the future. I fully support Ken’s statement that we need to take action. He emphasizes that cation shouldn’t been soon, but it should be right now. Some ways we could influence more influential people to address climate change is by voting. With twice the proportion of older voters actually voting than younger voters, we are at a significant disadvantage, but that can change.
 <br><br>


I promise to vote myself and convince my friends and family to vote. I also promise to bring up the topic of climate change and how it is a serious issue that we need take action on right now. I think that if my parents see me bringing up and trying to convince them on topics such as climate change, they will realize this is actually an important issue because I almost never talk about the environment or politics with my parents. Hopefully they can see my viewpoint and share it with their friends, resulting in many people voting to support climate change and for taking immediate action.

I found it entertaining to hear after watching "Why the generation that caused climate change is not acting" that there are some climate change deniers who actually believe that scientists are making up facts and numbers as a part of a huge corrupt scheme to make money. The idea that the same scientists who have devoted their entire lives to their research -- physicists, chemists, meteorologists, biologists, etc.-- went through all that work just to deceive people for money is hilarious (they just couldn't find another way to make money, right?) It's the same people who are pointing the blame to others who are really making profit--the fossil fuel industry and the government authorities representing them. Yes, it is true that the older generation (and many climate change deniers) controls much of what bills get passed making it very difficult to pass laws combating climate change. However, voters still have the power to elect other people into office, and it change starts with that will to keep fighting.

I really like your description of "a huge corrupt scheme" about the climate change deniers. They are always saying that they are helping the economy and creating new jobs. However, that is just a bunch of excuses for making dirty money. Also, your view that they are in control of the law is definitely true. I think the reason why they don't want to get any climate bill passed is international competitions on power. If they slow down the use of fossil fuels, relatively other superpower nations like Russia is not gonna stop anything. Eventually, there would be a risk that the US loses the advantage on some critical aspects. It is impossible to interfere with other countries' politics on climate change (not a nation like Russia or China) so there is no consensus among the powerful nations there would be no real action on the issue.

It truly is frustrating that the older generations don't seem to care about the harm they're causing to the environment and basically to their families. I guess they really are living by that, "I'm only here for a short time, not a long time" way of life because many politicians and CEOs are greedy and only care for themselves. It does suck that these older guys aren't believing scientists even with factual evidence, but hey there are people that still believe that the Earth is flat so I'm not really surprised lol. It is true that voters have the power to elect others, yet the younger generations apathetic values of politics is a huge problem that can't seem to be broken which affects the votes for people that actually give a damn about this climate crisis.
<br><hr>
It is disappointing to know that some people from the last generations do not really care about the climate changes. When I talked about this class with my parents, what they said was people in "your" generation is facing more climate problems. I think my parents are open-minded enough, but they still think it is young people's responsibilities to fix up the broken environment. Some politicians and businessmen argued that global warming is a lie made by the scientists and environmentalists. But actually, I think it is because they care more the short run profits. Though it is undeniable that we have some other developments which are as important as reducing the use of fossil feuls and emissions of greenhouse gases, we should never ignore the importance of environmenral issues.
<br><hr>

I too am angered at this fact that these huge corporations and fossil fuel companies are doing everything that they can to hide the true fact of the climate crisis. Instead of spending all of this money to cover up the truth, they should be devoting their time and resources to combatting this crisis. However, it is the sad truth that they will do anything for money even if it means that they have to deceive these innocent people. I was also shocked to learn in this video that the leading issues in the voter polls were revealed to be the economy, healthcare, and social security for the 2020 election instead of important issues such as the climate and our environment. This is a result in part because we are not making others as knowledgeable about this issue as they should be. I personally feel very strongly about this issue after learning the cold hard facts and I believe that other people would be more motivated too if they were to learn the truth. Therefore, it is important that we work to fight against the fossil fuel industries that are spreading these lies and instead spreading the truth instead.

The statistics given by Professor Hiltner do, in fact, make a lot of sense to why the majority of the U.S population including senators and congressmen do not consider climate change to be real. I remember that my freshman year of high school, I had a substitute teacher for my math class. My substitute teacher was also the Football coach of the school, who was a caucasian man, born and raised in the States, and was in his 50s. The day when he substituted my math class, he somehow started talking about climate crisis and he said that it was not real. I vividly recall him saying that the climate crisis was not real because Earth had always been through melting phases like during the Ice Age. The fact that he said that the climate crisis was not real, was mind boggling to me because at the time I did not know believing in the climate crisis was an option.
 <br><br>

I am aware that people in fact do not believe in the climate crisis for a number of reasons but it always comes down to their denial. The majority of their lives, they have lived in a wonderful world, where they have got the best of everything; thus, they fail to realize that they are no longer living in that world because of the fossil fuel companies. They can't believe their lifestyle has caused their wonderful world to vanish. Therefore, the second lecture video is so relevant because we, the new generation, has to make definitive changes in order to repair the mistakes done and prevent the situation from rising to a greater degree.

“Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting” brought forth very many valid reasons for why the older generations in the developed world are not acting to help. I know many kids my age who have parents that flat out deny the climate crisis. They all say exactly what Ken said, “there has always been bad storms... it’s the natural cycle of climate”. They fail to realize that the consequences of climate change have been delayed and are just now hitting us. The older generations are not concerned with global warming because they will not be around on this planet for much longer. It isn’t a priority to them, but it is a priority to those below the age of 40. It’s really disheartening that people who are older will continue to live their earth destructive lives.

Watching this video, I was surprised about the widespread denial of climate change in older generations. I knew that this denial certainly existed, but not to the extent that was mentioned in this video. Shown in the video was a concern poll that showed that “Baby boomers” rank climate change as the 18th most important thing to them. Other factors such as the economy and social security dominated these older generations concerns. It was made clear to me that these individuals cared solely on profits and the building of corporations instead of damaging the planet. 
 <br><br>


While I think that these individuals failed to recognize the Earth's health, I would argue that their was less knowledge and widespread concern on the subject. These people did not have access to the technology and tools that we now have to measure climate change. We also have Internet media and news programs, a tool that helps people to better understand the world. While to a large degree it is their fault, the technology and widespread communication is much more prominent in our world today.
 <br><br>


I believe that the younger generation is more concerned with climate change because of its urgency. If we do not act soon this generation will be susceptible to unnecessary famine, wars, and pain due to widespread negligence of past and current generations.

I agree with what you’re saying. It’s concerning to think about how much pressure is on us and our generation to undo the life that’s been given to us. It is on us now to deal with the repercussions from our parents and grandparents lifestyles. While on the subject of denial, my guess is that the past generations had heard of climate change but had no idea about its severity. I think during their lifetimes, they truly thought the economy and social security were greater threats. It’s hard for me to blame them because I don’t think they intended to leave us with such a large problem. Now maybe that’s me being too optimistic and I could be totally wrong. 
 <br><br>

I’d have to agree with you about their lack of knowledge and technology. Technology has grown so much in the past 20 years. Now everyone has access to information like no decades have before. So while maybe they did know climate change was a global issue, I think with the way the media was portraying things, war, the economy, and social services always seemed to be the bigger issues. 
 <br><br>

But now here we are, with the weight of climate change on our shoulders. It’s on us to take power from the 60+ year old adults who run the government and big businesses and use it to stop the progression of climate change before it’s too late. I don’t think this will be easy in any means, but we don’t have many other options. If we keep living like the generations before us there will be chaos (i.e. famine, plagues, war, migrations...ect.)
<br><Hr>

I completely agree with your statement, and I thought that the “Concern Ranking” graph helped shed this in an even more clearer light. While many of us are already aware of the ascending generational concern, the graph eliminated any existing doubt. The sad truth is that the generation that pumped out 3/4's of the CO2 in the atmosphere are still so stuck in their ways, convinced that anthropogenic climate change is a distant issue--that issues like our economy are far more important. Again, Ken mentioning that the developed world is at fault for this while the poorest half of humanity will suffer the consequences the most is disheartening to hear. I am proud that our generation is much more concerned about the climate crisis, and I hope that we are capable of evoking a change that ripples through all generations so that they can open their eyes and finally understand the problem at hand; denial and delay of the climate crisis is severely threatening our planet and it is sad to see an entire generation being blinded by that fact.

The most troubling thing I heard in Ken’s lecture videos was his explanation about climate change deniers. Growing up in northern California, I have never actually met a climate change denier in real life, so it is difficult for me to understand how some people choose not to believe these scientific facts. However, last quarter, I took a class on infectious diseases in which we discussed the anti-vaccination movement. I fully believe in the benefit of vaccination, and know that there is zero scientific proof that vaccination leads to disease or disorders. Similarly to the climate change issue, some people do not believe these scientific facts. I have , in fact, met a woman from my hometown who does not agree with vaccination and is part of the anti-vaccination movement, which she projects on her Instagram daily. I assume that the way I think about this woman and her ideals about anti-vaccination is the same way I would look at climate change deniers. It is difficult to fathom that some people do not agree with science and continue to put themselves and their children in harm's way, in both the cases of vaccination and climate change.

I see the analogy drawn between climate change deniers and those who do not vaccinate. Unlike Lane, I did not grow up in northern California and many people in my hometown did not “believe” in climate change. It is extremely difficult to try and discuss an issue that people fail to acknowledge as real, despite scientific evidence. I likewise have trouble understanding this denial and how to change someone’s mind when they are presented with facts and still choose to ignore them. Something drastic definitely needs to happen soon so an effort to end the global temperature rising can be put forth.

After Ken’s data in this lecture, I am so surprised that my generation is indeed the one cares about the climate crisis the most. I think the misunderstanding here is because I was and am taught to protect the environment all the time since I started to go to school. Therefore, it’s not hard to imagine that our teachers and parents generations care much more about the climate changes than me. I mean, how could they ask my generation to fix the problem which was mainly caused by them? On the other hand, this is exactly what they do. They want my generation to fix this problem, and they now become the teachers and say “oh you know what, the climate crisis is so extreme now because of us and you generation go make it better.” It’s ridiculous. It’s unfair at all. I think it’s too late already.

I actually am not surprised that our generation is the one that cares the most about the climate crisis. It's always us who you see on the news protesting, using our social medias to bring awareness to the fact that if we continue on the path we're on, the world won't last long. It's not surprising to see that it's the older generations that don't believe nor are concerned about the climate.

This video completely encapsulates my thoughts upon the generational divide between the boomer generation vs. our generation when it comes to the pressing issue of climate change. I think it's important to note that many boomers also support climate change efforts and believe that they are in the wrong for letting it get to this point such as Ken and others who knew this would happen but sadly that number is not as high enough as it should be, otherwise this problem would have been mildly dealt with by now on a large scale. The problem is that the older generation has lived a life entirely in the era where the visible effects of climate change were not yet readily accessible or heard of whereas we have better interconnection with the rest of world through things such as social media and the internet which makes information about what's going on in the world so much more accessible. We have the visual proof and research to back up climate change now but this news is just so unfamiliar to the experience of the older generation that they refuse to think of it as facts because it contrasts with their reality, which is so frustrating for us younger people.
 <br><br>

I truly hope that in the future as the younger generations continue to get more educated and the last of ignorant older generations finally are replaced by them we will finally take vast global steps to delaying the inevitable causes of climate change for a little while longer. I understand that at this point we cannot stop climate change due to the negligence of the past but there is still a little bit of hope for life on earth as a whole if we push a little bit harder with out environmentalist efforts so that our children and our children's children may yet see a habitable Earth in the future.

This is a very well thought out comment and I believe you are mostly correct except for one thing, the fact that the boomer generation did not know of climate change. The scientist from that generation knew that the release of CO2 into the air would cause, and was causing changes to the planet. Yet, because these changes were not very visible, their generation dismissed it as the fossil fuel industry was making the developed world the most advanced countries in the world. This exploitation is what separated the rich/developed countries from the poor/undeveloped countries and people did not want to give that up. Also, some people may have been in denial of these scientists facts because the results were not seen. Although now, our generation and even people in Ken’s generation are realizing the urgent nature of this problem, and that is because of the things that you said such as social media, the internet, and more. The information is now very accessible, along with the solutions, therefore people needed to find plans to help reverse climate change that go along with their lives. I don't believe everyone needs to go vegan or stop flying, but I do believe people should adopt the changes that are manageable in their life to help save the world.

Even if old people knew about the severity of climate change, I’m not sure that they will care as it won’t affect them very much in their lifetime. As mentioned in class, the effects of climate change have been known for a long time, and if they hadn’t done anything before, I don’t expect them to have a sudden change in perspective and change their entire lifestyle.

I feel bad for professor Hiltner after watching all these videos. He's undoubtedly doing a lot more than his counterparts and you can tell he cares. As far as content goes, these two lecture videos gave me good insight as to why a lot a lot of people 40+ especially those 60+ don't see climate change as a huge issue. Most elected officials in congress really are like 60 and older, and no disrespect to any elders, but I don't believe that's right. I personally think it should be scattered and should represent the population of our nation as a whole. I definitely do agree that our generation really needs to get out there and they really need to vote. Sadly, political power means a lot. At this moment, the younger people in this world don't hold the power. On top of this, Professor Hiltner does a good job at relaying the message that most of the world is going to experience devastation that they didn't even ask for, let alone contribute to. Not even humans but all other life forms are struggling and dying just for the benefit of those few people at the top. 
 <br><br>
All anyone can really ask for is to make sure every individual just does their part. Sadly most people don't and that is something that needs to change. Not just in regards to climate change, but in regards to anything that is life changing...

After the video, I can understand the reason why the old generation is so negative to deal with the climate crisis. In the opposite, it is our young generation that make a lot effort to deal with it. Climate crisis is a really serious problem. If we cannot solve this problem, the earth, which is the only place that we can live, will be damaged irreversibily. So we should really pay attention to this problem now.

I find “Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting” snippet interesting! It answers my questions of why the older generations don’t regard climate change as the priority issue. For instance, many think scientist predictions are wrong, “under the plot to undermine democracy.” That’s not even a valid argument, climate change isn’t a political issue. Why would protecting the planet, our home, a bad thing?  I think it’s important that we need to have conversations with our parents( mentioned in the next snippet) explaining how this issue will affect their children, grandchildren, and more generations after. Lastly, we need to vote, to make an impact since as mentioned, many people in power are people in their 60s and 70s. We can’t wait until our generations are in those chairs to make change, we need to start now.

<p>
The video " Why the Generation that Caused the Climate Crisis is not Acting" revealing that how the older generations are almost indifferent to the global warming effects mainly caused by their generations. It surprised me that the poll consequences of the generations of baby boomers, Gen X, and 75+, which rated the climate crisis at such a lower rank. Obviously according to the data, the CO2 emitting rate is raising exponentially, from 0.5% in 2015 to 2.7% in 2018 is such a large leap, and the outcomes is that the younger generation and non-human lives will have to suffer from those probably for a long time in the future. And the older generations did not care about it simply because they will not see the consequence in their life-time, so they don't care about it. 
 <br><br>

This lecture definitely remind us that we have to do more to stop, or at least minimize the possible effects of our behaviors in the past. It is unfair to let other people, animals, or even plants that did nothing to it facing this situation. We have to come up with a solution as soon as possible and take more actions to pay off what we have done wrong in the past. Environmental education should not only be taught to the students, but also adults who are damaging our Earth without realizing it.

I wasn’t surprised to see that environmental issues ranked lower and lower as the age demographics rose. With our current scientific understanding of climate change, we should have already sounded the alarm and started making large-scale changes years ago. However, the politicians in power currently and the generation that caused the climate crisis are out of touch with the reality of the situation. It is all the more likely that the politicians and oil executives claiming that climate change is fake are corrupt than the scientists who are trying to warn the public. They are the only ones who stand to profit from continued abuse of the environment; meanwhile, people from poorer countries, animals, and future generations will suffer from the selfish and ignorant actions of a few. I think that environmental youth movements - similar to the anti-war protests in the 1960’s-1970’s - will play a large role in bringing about the change we need. The younger generations are already driving the movement forward - Greta Thunberg’s more alarmist approach has raised awareness around the world, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is bringing the Green New Deal to the front lines, and activist groups like Sunrise continue to bring changes locally. Voter turnout is also increasing in our generation. Although the politicians that have caused this to begin with have not yet been held accountable, our votes and our voices can overpower the stronghold of the oil industry if we continue fighting for the planet.

In my opinion, global warming and climate degradation cannot be blamed on a generation or a person, because each of us is using the limited energy of the earth, but some people are born early and some people are born late. Some people will surely say that the future generation of young people will live in a bad environment on the earth, which is not their choice. The old generation needs to be responsible for this. I'm very confused about what it means to be responsible for this kind of thing. We've been calling for someone or a generation to take responsibility. I'm worried that, as you said, 70% of Americans now think that climate change is caused by human behavior. This means that we knowingly destroy the planet where our children will live, but we did nothing about it. We are just doing some useless confession and accountability for this. My parents once said to me that our hard work is for you to have a better life. We can know the meaning of life is to create a better living environment for us and our future generations. But I think this kind of environment should not only related to money, education and spiritual, but also leave a relatively livable living environment for our future generations. Please stop confessing and take action.

This lecture video did a good job of showing the importance of climate change but there are not enough that are informed by it. I agree that if more people were informed and the consequences that come with it, then this issue would be taken much more seriously. I feel like commercials on TV, billboards on the highways, and newspaper ads are so prejudice about what certain things they showcase and censor. It just does not make sense to me that this is Earth's biggest issue but I don't see any source of media information on it. Although I do not want to believe that the previous generations were the ones that caused this because I also believe that my generation is a big contributor to climate change but the fact that older ages are resenting this problem, irritates me. Being around college kids and other young generation, we are doing the most to try and inform communities. We are holding protests, marches, and rallies to raise the concern for climate change. Companies for oil and petroleum will continue to release more levels of CO2 unless we control it and that all starts by speaking and supporting political candidates about their beliefs on the problem.

I agree with the message "Why the generation that caused climate change is not acing" has to put out. It makes sense as to why most older people do not believe in climate change, however this is not an excuse. I think the power usually lies within older populations as it takes years of dedication to become a high member in congress or gain political influence. Because of this, we will not see major advances toward the slowing of climate change until we can educate the older populations on how real and alive climate change really is. We as America contribute the most to this crisis and I think most companies that are emitting the greenhouse gases are not willing to sacrifice some wealth to save the planet.
 <br><br>


I think that many climate change deniers are preconceived as "dumb" or as believing in absurd ideas, but I think  a better word to describe these people would be selfish. Most climate change deniers give in to poorly constructed arguments that deny the climate crisis simply because it benefits these people to hold these beliefs. It makes their life easier. Being the CEO of a oil or gas company would force cognitive dissonance if that CEO believed in the climate crisis. Either the CEO would have to change his actions(stop emitting gases) to adjust to his belief, or he would have to change his belief in climate change and continue his actions. I think the latter is the easiest for most people. Until this changes, the climate crisis will still live and grow.

It is disappointing how far this climate crisis has escalated simply because of human greed and selfishness. Ken mentions how the US and European countries are responsible for the majority of carbon emissions, yet the rest of the world has to suffer from their actions. Innocent people from underdeveloped countries and countless other species of animals have contributed little to nothing to the issue, yet they must bear the weight of the crisis. It reminds me of the economic disparity in the United States, and how the richest 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 90% combined. This amount of wealth is unnecessary, and stems from pure greed. Those top 1% have more money than they even know what to do with. The same goes for fossil fuel companies. It is completely unnecessary for them to exploit the environment to the point it is today just to gain more money for themselves, money they can’t even fully enjoy or spend. In exchange for their selfish desires, generations will have to suffer as a consequence. 
 <br><br>

It’s also disappointing how our government is structured where one generation holds almost all the power. In democracy, the elected officials are supposed to represent the people, yet only the desires of the older generations are fulfilled. The older generation is self-centered, only caring about issues that immediately affect them, like the economy. They have no regard for the consequences of their actions on the future generations, and do nothing to reverse their mistakes.

It is sickening to see how many eligible voters in this developed country takes advantage of the CO2 lifestyle and not give any thought about the climate crisis as they prepare their votes for the upcoming election. It truly solidifies the importance of me being an American born citizen with the power to vote and decide what is best not only for my country, but for the world. I can remember all the times my mom would talk to me about the importance of voting and how my vote counts, no matter what happens. I can remember all the times my mom would tell me how she wishes to be a naturalized American citizen so she can do more for this country, instead of being just another number within the U.S. population. She originally came from a 3rd world country and has already seen the consequences of our abusive actions with climate change. She has seen the disastrous volcanic eruptions, the earthquakes, the floods, the fires, she has seen it all yet it seems like many people within her generation still brings a blind eye to this issue.
 <br><br>


That being said, I try my best to not play the blame game on the generations before mine, because I know I am just mimicking what the past generations are doing right now. We keep blaming each other, we keep talking, we keep arguing but is there any action happening? No. I understand that there are faults and responsibilities on who did what, but we need to look past that. We need to stop blaming but actually do something since we are much more aware of the crisis at hand. Many people within different generations, I have seen it in mine as well, only complain and argue, but let's change that. Let's actually get up and do something, and that is why I am glad I can see it within my generation and some people within the past generations. There is more to do than just complaining that the Baby Boomers or the 75+ Group are not acknowledging the problem, we need to vote and take action. Yes it is important to acknowledge that there are many individuals that do not believe in this crisis, but we need to look pass that and take action. We cannot keep sulking and be woeful of the past, but we need to bring confidence and determination to the present and vote, so that we can start changing and fixing the mistakes of the past.

From this video, it can give us feedback with the reason why previous older generation do not treat climate issue as a big problem. Instead, younger generation like us, put much more effort in protecting our environment. For those undeveloping country, would likely suffer the most. As far as I would concern, we should try our best to find a way to save our homeland, the place where we live and can't live without with. The older generation have already damaged enough, what we need to do right now is to reduce unnecessary emission and be strict to oil control and CO2 emission.

I agree. While listening I was also impacted by the comment that the poorest countries, and the animals, were the ones who had to pay the price for the carelessness of our country regarding the climate. I think a president with a more realistic viewpoint on climate change is absolutely necessary if the united states is going to make any significant changes.

 <br><br>



I think that eventually it might become illegal to deny climate change, such as it is illegal to deny the holocaust in Europe, because confusing people on the climate change when it has been absolutely confirmed is just not fair. Once we come together with a plan for our next generations elected officials the climate crisis will be much easier to beat. Until then, we definitely will need to come together just as a society to do what we can to help, regardless of current public policy. Overall, I thought this video was very interesting, just like basically everything else in this class.

In my opinion, I don’t think the carbon emissions and the crisis should be blamed upon a generation. Every generation has it’s duty. And the last generation’s duty was to develop. They need to strong their industry and economy. So, I believe it was actually inevitable to lead to the carbon emissions to achieve their goal and we can enjoy our convenient lives nowadays, we can ride vehicles instead of walking hundreds of miles, we also can enjoy the air-conditioner during the summer. All of these lead to carbon emissions also during the manufacture times. However, development was the tendency of the world at the times of the last generation. So, we actually don’t have the rights to blame them, since we are now enjoying their achievements to make our lives better. 
 <br><br>
However, the real problem is, although it seems cruel, I have to say that there are some many people think the situation is not that bad. Since we can only hear scared news, numbers and statistics, instead of experiencing some really bad consequences ourselves. For example, although Fire in Paradise told a so horrible story, the truth is people won’t have such a strong felling, unless they have experienced it. So, many of us, actually, may think the climate crisis is so far away from us and no matter what we do, we won’t experience the bad results, because our generation have already died at that time, so they really pay little attention to all of these serious issues.

Until you showed me the polls and the data, I was convinced that more people of my parents age cared about climate change. But seeing that it wasn’t even in the top ten things that they considered important issues is deeply disheartening. The generations of the past either don’t seem to care about the planet or they figure that if not much has changed since they were our age, that climate change is overblown and exaggerated. I completely agree that the age of our most powerful leaders in the country is incredibly one sided. We cannot have the most important decisions of our country be ran by uneducated, senile, elderly people who are so out of touch with the outside world that they didn’t understand how google works. The incompetence pushed by our structure of those in power, seeks only to prolong their power and work in their own self-interest. A large factor, in my opinion, of why the older generation doesn’t care about climate change, is because they wont live to see the day when the world in the chaos they created. With the amount of funding being given to the military, we could focus on a worldwide program to reduce carbon emissions and clean our planet. We spend 770 billion a year on military. Why do we need military bases all over the world and in other countries? No other country has that. We spend more on the military than we do on healthcare and education. In short, if the older generation cared about saving the planet instead of controlling such a large military, we probably wouldn’t be in the situation we are in.

I too believe that we have people in power that are both too out-of-touch from the outside world and too selfish to help  future generations. Although the younger and more informed generation will eventually take their place in these public office positions,  we do not have the luxury to wait for this to happen. People in power need to realize the significance of climate change and focus on related issues, if we really want to make a change for the future.


<br><hr>
I am very much in agreement with you about our military spending. It is absolutely insane how much we devote to it, and how little we should actually be using it. Also, it is true that our government is currently being run by someone who is grossly incompetent, especially in regards to climate change, but I do think that we will get someone there who does genuinely care and that realizes how much of an issue climate change is. I do think that most of the older generations are ignorant about climate change, and while it is disheartening and frustrating, is also does make sense. They are old, therefore I am sure most are only thinking about how they are going to live out the remainder of their lives, and thus care more about issues like healthcare and social security. I can’t really blame them for that, because if I was old and needed to take care of myself, I might be more worried about medical bills or how I was going to retire and still be able to live. I am not saying this completely excuses them from their lack of knowledge about climate change or how out of touch they are, but I think our generation really needs to consider all factors that led them into that way of thinking so that way we do not make the same errors ourselves.

Why the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting
<br><br>
As I mentioned before, people is lacking understanding about the negative influence of climate crisis. Governors and leaders are denying the fact of climate change could cause more in fiscal perspective. Although it is understandable about the need of fossil fuel (most products in the market use as the main resource to operate). There are too much reasons for people to develop theories about denials of a climate crisis. Especially for developing countries such as China, India, Vietnam etc. the importance for financial gains weights more than warm house effect control. However, there are too signs that supporting the climate crisis is happening to them.

My initial thought to this lecture video was wow, if we have put 75% of the overall CO2 into the atmosphere in the last 60 years and we are only emitting more and more per year where does that leave our planet for the next 60 years? We have more people now, which means more cars on the road, more electricity being used, more food being eaten. This is a daunting idea that it’s only getting worse for us and was originally caused by my parents' generation, but is being added to by mine. I think that it is no longer a generational issue and we don’t need to keep putting blame on people, we now need to work together and take action to help prevent further emissions and destruction to our planet. It is horrible to think that many developing countries are feeling the affects of (mostly from our emissions), but now that is even more incentive to try to stop and fix what we have done for the lives of everyone. People are in denial about the horrors of climate change, but we need to see the reason and the facts that our planet is being affected and we need to unite together to fix it.  
<br><br>

 It's hard to know the solution to “fix it” like what I mentioned above, but we need to get politicians, lobbyists, and civilians to work together for the sake of their world. My generation needs to raise its voices to the older generation to help influence and educate them on what has been done, but be optimistic in the sense that we can work together and try to combat what we have done.

I agree that climate change is only getting worse. The point you made, that there are more people on the planet which means there is more pollution makes it so much harder for our generation to turn climate change around. I believe if the United States works on emitting less CO2 in the atmosphere we will solve a large portion of it. Like you said this starts with politicians, lobbyists, and civilians to work together and all be on the same page. If we are all on the same page it will be a lot easier to try and find solutions for climate change. Our generation is one of the most important factors of climate change because we can tell our kids how it is affecting us and that generation will automatically think it's a major problem. We can also influence the older generation into believing climate change is real and happening.

After watching the two lecture snippets, I was interested how ¾ of the CO2 is put into the atmosphere within my professor lifetime and what are possible actions that I can take to make the world a safer and happier place. It was interesting how the lecture snippet was informing how denying climate change is very popular in this developing world, yet there are a lot of natural disasters occuring for it to be simply neglected. It is sad to say since we are neglecting climate change, andwe are wasting time to make a change and stand up to resolve the solution. I was interested when he took about all the three groups specifically and how each one is all affected by climate change no matter how much they affect it. They are all affected by climate change and risk their chance of survival.The first snippet emphasizes how the older generations are more likely to vote against the younger generations which gains more popularity of vote against climate change and not resolving a lot of the issues.Older people, 75+,  don’t think climate change and ways to stop as a priority as he younger generations do. The older generation have more authority since people involved in the government who have higher positions and are involved in voting. As well, the younger generations aren’t able to vote since they aren’t retired and the political events are usually held during times of work. It  makes them able to have  more say in this kind of topic. As well, since we're not doing nothing to fix the co2 not going to the atmosphere, we are only going to make the percentage increase. The CO2 percentage are already double significantly each year and even more if we don’t don’t do anything to prevent it. I really liked how the video emphasizes how voting is a key factor because being involved politically can actually make a positive factor to decrease the CO2. In addition, the video mentions how violence doesn’t solve anything because it just makes matters worse.

I very much agree with your statement, when you said ‘“Denying climate change is very popular in this developing world, yet there are a lot of natural disasters occurring for it to be simply neglected.” It’s so sad to hear that there are still people who deny climate change but it is devastating to realize that although the majority of the public believes in climate change almost everyone in power is delaying the climate crisis. It seems the only people who want to make a change now are the younger generations who are not in Congress, who are not in public offices or can’t even vote yet. We watch helplessly as the amount of CO2 only increases year after year. Americans see natural disasters occur in other countries and send prayers and say “Well, at least it isn’t happening here.” It is happening here like with what we saw in the Fire in Paradise film. The only thing that will end the climate crisis is informing and educating the public and hoping that they will vote against greenhouse gas emissions so that politicians can finally make reforms.
<br><hr>
What really caught my intention while reading your comment was the idea of how there is so much negligence and denial in terms of the climate crisis. It is genuinely beyond me. What adds to my frustration is the fact that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, refuses to accept the reality of climate change. What's more, is that this man decided not only to be in denial in the face of climate change but rather add on to the detriments of climate change. "We’re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.” I was completely lost for words when I heard about this and I still am beyond shocked as to this close-minded declaration. Trump is a member of the older generation who has so poorly instigated the climate crisis havoc. Now accountability must be taken at the very minimum but the fact that many elders are voting against the younger generation is appalling. As a kid when I misbehaved at home and once I realized what I was doing was wrong, I would apologize and try my best to right my wrongs. A kid is able to do this yet a considerable elderly population isn't able to do the same? That is honestly beyond me. Authority should not be in their hands and if it carries on this way we will all be in grave danger.

I have read Pope Francis encyclical in regards to climate change and the connection to poverty in a previous class and it seems such an unfair thing that those who have not contributed much will suffer.  Knowing that the hottest parts of the world will become hotter, people with essentially no houses will suffer especially from the heat. Going through famines because of droughts or even excessive rain and no one will really act because these issues technically do not concern us and they definitely do not concern the big oil tycoons and big companies that take advantage of the forests. I personally believe that the reasons the generation has caused climate change is not acting because of political parties and the fact that the change occurs later. The truth is that even if half of the people do not believe in climate change, those who do not believe tend to be the ones with the most power. 
<br><br>

People that have not contributed, nonhuman life, and the future generations have and will suffer greatly. Animals that were not even endangered have become extinct because of the destruction of their natural habitats. The older generations still have power and as much as I love the idea of protests. My government class taught us that there has always been a larger amount of people who vote that are older so on top of our legislation being primarily older then the people who tend to have the most say are also older as well. 
<br><br>

Speaking personally, I feel as if that my actions does not fully change the course of climate change. Small and minor changes I can make can cause such a slight difference but the most important thing to me is that the people who will be effected by climate change are not in office. How do I expect the people in power to go through with actions that do not effect them. This sort of hopelessness is heartbreaking to think but the only thing that can change something is my vote and my hope that other people of my generation will vote as well. There will be a time in which my all of generation will realize that climate change is very real- my main hope is that it is not too late and that we will have time.

I really agree with the fact that we can act at the moment to do what we can. We can start with something small. This winter break, when I went back to China, I noticed how the government and many Chinese people have made efforts to be more friendly to the environment. For instance, in the past, most families only had one trash bag to throw everything into, and they did not bother to recycle. Now, more and more cities carry out policies in which people who are caught not doing garbage classification will need to pay a fine. Also, markets started to charge plastic bags, so now my family would always bring our own reusable bags when we go shopping, and we also like to leave some on our cars, just in case. I am glad to see those changes made by different generations of people. Besides consciously making those little efforts, we can also move towards the goal of taking over control of the planet. I do agree with the professor that his generation currently has major control. The transition from one generation to the other definitely takes time, but we will be making progress as long as we raises awareness and strive for the goal.

I like how optimistic you are and look to  continue moving forward despite how depressing thinking about climate change can be. You are right, more and more people all over the world  mobilizing to change our ways. My biggest fear is that the change in the U.S. is not happening fast enough, or on a large enough scale. This is partially due to the fact that  a lot of the change that is happening is optional and is being done by people who want to lower their emissions voluntarily rather than  it coming from the government like in China. This is definitely because the people running our country are much older and like Ken said, lived most of their life without seeing the consequences of their actions. This will change eventually as younger generations start coming into power, but that will also take time, and that is the one thing we don't have. The time to act was yesterday, today is late, and tomorrow doesn't exist.  As you can tell, I am not very optimistic about our chances, which is why I enjoyed reading your comment.

I really connected with the focus of this particular lecture video, I think it did a great job of emphasizing the major problem encountered by today’s generation in fighting the climate crisis. A lack of a voice. While our generation can be extremely environmentally aware and eco-friendly, at the end of the day they are not the ones with power and influence.
<br><br>

The problem with modern society is that those in power are not connected with the current generation. The CEOs, Politicians, and Government officials currently in power may not share the same mindsets or values that they have. While the environment and its protection may be priorities for today’s youth, this is obviously not the case for those currently in power. Because of this, my generation is forced to hold marches, petitions, and rallies to raise awareness for Climate change. 
<br><br>

We are forced to raise our voices in the hopes of enacting change rather than enacting that change ourselves. Our current society has caused us to rely on those in power to protect our planet. This has caused major problems as many of the influential figures in modern society are the “climate deniers” that Ken references in the video. No matter how educated the current generation is on the dangers of climate change. Right now, they are not the ones that need to be convinced. Instead, those in power need to hear our voice and enact change

I completely agree that the central topic of this video efficiently emphasized the major problem that this generation is having when attempting to fight climate change. Our lack of voice and power is what is restricting us from making real change. Although we are the MOST aware and conscientious generation regarding our role in reversing climate change, that won't be enough if we don't have the power to make change.
<br><br>
When Professor Hiltner explained the older generations' priorities when voting in the upcoming election, I was completely surprised. The fact that baby boomers only put climate change's importance at 18 out of 29 different topics shocked me. Putting border control and terrorism before climate change is incredibly selfish and small minded. It also does not help us that 2/3 people over 60 are voting, when only 1/3 people between 18 and 29 are voting. We clearly need to take action.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your response to the video, especially the key problem you observed with the current generation’s inability to enact change: a lack of voice.  It is true that while we can hold marches and walk out of schools and live in fairly sustainable ways we are not the ones that can truly make change happen.  This fills me with pain and sadness; while my generation is the one that will have to live with the effects of climate change and spend our entire lives trying to preserve the ground we walk on we have no power in making that change happen while it can still mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis.
<br><br>


As you pointed out, the problem is a lack of connection and communication between the ones in power and those being impacted the most by their decisions.  I found it incredibly interesting and deeply frightening that the majority of the older generations do not view the climate crisis as a more prevalent issue.  Although I agree that immigration policies and the economy and terrorism are issues that need to addressed, none of this will matter if the earth rejects humans and continues to exist without us.  I know this seems extreme and pessimistic but if we continue to do what we are doing the earth will survive but we will not.  I do not think that humans realize the true casualty of the climate crisis will not be the destruction of the globe but the death of humans and the vast majority of other living creatures currently residing on this planet’s surface.

<br><hr>

I agree that this video really clarified why my generation can’t do much about climate change. I feel like we as a generation are actually speaking out about it quite a lot but I haven’t seen much of a change within our governments (especially the U.S. government).This video presents a lot of interpreted data that concisely shows us that most of the people in our current governments ( the people that hold the most power, such as supreme court justices) are a part of the generation that doesn’t really take climate change seriously.
<br><br>

I also agree that the current generations in power are simply not in sync with my generation's mindset. I think that it wouldn’t be that difficult for our governments to change a bit to allow for more “green” values, but it would take putting in more people of my generation into government positions. Even if these people aren’t put in extremely high positions, they could still work towards changing the current laws in place to make them more “green”.

<br><hr>
I agree with you, while our generation can be environmentally aware, we are not the ones in power. Those in power don't seem to care about us and we cannot depend on them. What we can do is to vote for people who share the same ideals and values as our generation and to spread awareness. It's hard to see change when most of the people  who hold power in our society are the people Hiltner calls the "climate deniers." I think it will be difficult to convince that generation of the climate crisis because at the end of the day, it isn't their problem anymore. They have lived out their lives, burning tons of fossil fuels and releasing tons of CO2 in the air without a care in the world. It's up to us now, whether we like it or not, to take action now and make our voices heard.
<br><hr>


I agree with your response to the topic. It is frustrating that the biggest factor for climate change is greed. Because of profits, the climate change crisis is oftentimes being ignored or framed for being a conspiracy. This makes it difficult for those that are informed of the issue have their voices heard. In the case of baby boomers, they are not acting on this as they do not have to face the repercussions of their actions. The fact that most of the people who hold power and wealth consist of baby boomers makes it hard for this issue to be progressively acted upon. By the time the scope of influence passes on to the next generation who are vocal about climate change, it would be too late. The argument against the existence of climate change is based on propaganda and greed instead of logic. Blinded by wealth, those in power chose to live their comfortable lifestyles, unable to relate to or sympathize with those in the world without the resources or the time to prepare against such planetary devastation.

I agree with the point that the older generation is less concerned about climate change. The older generation is responsible for the damage they have done to the earth. Although the older generation destroys the planet by releasing CO2 and burning fossil fuel, they do nothing to protect the environment. In the video, 70 percent of Americans now believe that climate change is caused by human activity, but sadly, people still do not put climate problems in priority. And climate change was ranked so low in the top political issues in the United States. Last quarter, when I took the English 22 class, I found that many scientists and scholars support that the climate crisis is a hoax. They think the climate crisis is a conspiracy that benefits big companies and politicians. As a student, I don’t know how this works, but I know what happens in my life. Climate change indeed occurs now, and it influences our life. It must be viewed as a serious issue, and we need to pay more attention to it. For those who do not believe in the climate crisis, what we should do is use our knowledge and available data to show them what happens today in our earth.

I agree with what you said in this lecture, Ken. Nowadays, global warming is always not an obvious problem for many older people. According to the lecture, most controllers of companies or government s are held by people have a higher age. In this way, these kinds of people are not able to notice the consequences of global warming, or sometimes they do not believe the accuracy of the data about environmental issues. however, the global warming problem is not a joke because it has to be fixed as soon as possible. Fortunately, for younger generation, they would pay more attention to environment because of their individual experience of the changing atmosphere. In this class, I believe most students are passioned about taking care of the environment because they are able to familiar what the impacts are under global warming which can let them be cautious about these events. Therefore, more people can join the helping groups to improve the Caron dioxide problem and save the world as soon as they can.

I think it is important to remember that the people who take climate change the least seriously are going to be holding corporate and political power for the next 15-25 years.  We need to move away from trying to convince the older generations to help stop climate change and instead provide economic and political incentive for the older generations to put climate change at the forefront of our issues.  For example, Asset Management company Black Rock has stated it will put climate change at "the center" of their portfolio policy.  If they act on their word, it would make sense for the young working class to invest with them instead of other asset management firms.  The same can be said about politicians.  We need to vote for politicians who hold climate change in high regard for their public policy decisions.  While this does not make the older generations genuinely care about climate change, providing incentives to slow climate change will nevertheless make our world a better place.

<p>
Let me start by saying that I am upset at Ken's generation for failing to do something about climate change. I cannot blame everyone, especially those like Ken who have tried to bring change to our world. I do not know how much he has done but whether his contribution has been small or big, he at least had the courage to stand and act. Ken talks about why his generation has been unable to do something with respect to the climate crisis. Wait, let me rephrase this: why his generation has been so oblivious with respect to the climate crisis. It hurts to think that they had the chance to do something about our future; the future their children were going to live in. It is true that the son/daughter inherits the sins of their parents.
 <br><br>

More than 3/4 of carbon dioxide has been a contribution of Ken's generation. This is incredibly outrageous if you think about it. In a single lifetime, they have abundantly contaminated the world. What is worse is that his generation is still in control of the politics of the world. The same people that did not do anything to help mitigate the problem we are facing now. It is so hard to make them listen about what climate change has done to our world because they deny everything. They suffer from both climate delayed and climate denial which ultimately results in no action. I thought it was ridiculous to hear they deny that climate change even exist. You would expect to hear denial on the existence of aliens, area 51, zombies, monsters, even God, yet we hear denial on climate change. Is it just me or does this sound ridiculous? I wonder if the next thing out of their mouths is going to be that ghosts exist. 
 <br><br>

Ken proposed in the other video a plan to mitigate the climate crisis: to take control of the planet by any means necessary. I'm just kidding about this last part. But he is right about taking control over the planet. Not with violence but with peace and union. What Ken meant was that we need to act as soon as possible and with the simplest form of action: voting. If we vote for those politicians that want to bring change to our world by bringing up the problem of climate change, then we can work towards a better future. In order for this to work, we have to inform our parents, families, friends, relatives and everyone who will inherit the earth. We are going to be the ones who will suffer if we don't do anything.
 <br><br>

Earlier, I said I was mad at Ken's generation for not doing anything with respect to climate change, but I am also mad at my generation and myself included. If we refuse to act as our previous generation did, then we are not better than them. In fact, we would be remembered as the generation who had the chance to save the earth, but failed to do so. I don't know about y'all but I want my kids to live in a world they can enjoy, and see the marvelous things I have seen and now are disappearing. My career goals are not particularly focused on climate change, but I can definitely participate and contribute to help solve this crisis as a side job. We have to stop blaming Ken's generation for not doing anything. It's our turn to do something and we cannot do that if we still hold the previous generation accountable. I'll finish this comment with a quote from Albert Einstein: “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”

I enjoyed reading your intake about the situation because I completely agree with you. I also find it unbelievable that now a days people are still denying the reality and severity of the climate crisis. These people who refuse to see the truth are the ones running the government and preventing any substantial change from occurring. Therefore, it is up to us to make a change because if we expect the further generation to fix what we failed to fix, it will be too late of anyone to survive the horrible conditions which were brought about from the previous generation. Overall, I found your comment humorous and insightful.
<br><hr>
While I too am frustrated with how long this issue has gone on, and how we are now the ones to suffer the consequences of a previous generations actions, I think it is also important to think about whether or not we really are justified in blaming them so completely, at least to a point. It is easy for us to point the finger at previous generations and make them take the blame, claiming that they should have done better or done things differently. I think they should have but hindsight is 20/20 and is too easy to use in many situations. It is different when you are living during that time, and there are far bigger issues that affect people immediately or in the short-term. Had they been able to really see and understand the consequences at the time, I do think a significant portion of them would have acted differently. Most human beings don't consider the day to day long term impact they have on the world.  We are only addressing climate change now because it is directly affecting us.  But back then, when it didn't affect us would we have cared that much?  I don't know, but I doubt it. Many of them could not see the extent of the damage they were going to do, and the science was not nearly as widely-known and accessible as it is today. If the world was in the exact same place as it was 60+ years ago, and we all grew up during that time, we probably would have acted similarly. While Ken’s generation should at least acknowledge that the actions they took during that time have severely impacted our climate and world, I think it is also important that we have a good understanding of the world during that time, and the context in which they were living.
<br><hr>
I also feel upset about Ken's generation failing to take action on climate change. Specifically, when he said, "The older you are the less urgent you will likely find the climate crisis" saddened me. I understand that taking responsibility is hard, especially when many are pointing their fingers at them, however they must put their pride aside and take action and make the climate crisis a priority. I feel they do not think it is important because most of them have lived their lives without seeing the consequences and now that it is affecting our generation more they do not feel they should be cleaning up the mess that won't really affect them in the decades to come. Nevertheless, our generation is fighting strong against the climate crisis and I am optimistic we will win. We have to continue bringing awareness to the deniers in hopes that they too join our fight. Not only would our generation be affected, but so will our children's and their children and so on. Human life will continue, but the planet can only take so much from us. We need to take better care of it now.

<br><hr>
You are absolutely right that they had other things going on at the time. You could also say that for this generation. Our politicians do not see climate change as something of great concern. Yes, I blame the previous generation for not acting on time. However, I also said that we should stop blaming them because now it's our time to bring a change. We could pretend that climate change is not that big of an issue and instead focus on national security, war, health, etc. Here it's an example: If someone from the future tells you how and when you re going to die, wouldn't you do anything to change the way you live? In a similar way, scientists have warned high ranking authorities about earth's dark future. They should have taken initiative and propose ideas that could have been improved of the years to reduce CO2 emissions. If we had been born during that time and hadn't done anything, then we are to blame. So regardless of what they did or didn't do, it is our turn to change where the earth is heading. They do not care (not all of them) whether this get solved or not. They will not be able to live the worse, while we will. Therefore, I stated that we need to forget about Ken's generation approached to climate change. We need to stop holding them accountable, and start doing something for our future.
<br><hr>
  I am also confident that our generation will bring climate peace or at least will make a path for that. The more awareness we bring to the population and teach them about the importance of the phenomena, change will happen. I loved how you said that they need to "put their pride away" because that is a big problem our politicians have. This so called pride blind them of what is in front of them. Maybe they are not to blame just as Ken is not, but at least Ken said apologized for the problems caused by his generation. That takes a lot of courage to do and I respect that. There needs to be more people like him in his generation. History has taught us to learn form our mistakes. We mistakenly ignored climate change once, but we should not do it a second time because then it will definitely be too late to do something about.

I totally agree with you. It is everyone's responsibility to contribute to this issue. We have no right or no need to blame it on that generation, because the fault is not just on them, and the main problem that we should focus on here is not find out who to blame for. Instead, it is how to mitigate the climate crisis. If we just focus on blaming it on them, we have no difference from them.

<br><hr>
Exactly! this is what I was referring to. We need to stop blaming others because that will not do anything for us. Instead, we have to do what they didn't do. We all live on this earth and we all need to take care of it. We shouldn't have to wait until it's too late. The sooner we come up with plans to reduce global change, the faster we are going to be able to control it.
<br><hr>
I admire the mature turn you took on this assignment. Towards the end, you mention that it is now our duty, our job, our responsibility to take action. We cannot sit idly by and point fingers at the people that sparked this crisis, we must act with all we have and all we are. The light is now on the younger generations to do something real. Vote if you can vote. Speak if you have a voice. How much better could our generation be if we simply nag and not act? There has to be power in our intentions. We all have something to give, whether it's media influence, creativity, or a passion to assemble people of similar interests, we must exercise our strengths. This problem is big, and we will need a bigger amount of people to help fix it.
<br><hr>
Thanks for your comment! I appreciate your kind words and I just want to say that you are absolutely right. There has to be intent in our actions to succeed in our goals. Our generation has the tools to spread awareness of climate change to the entire globe, and together create policies to ensure our future and the future of the generations to come. We have to use all the resources that are available to us to start shaping our future into a better one. It’s possible that it will take years to repair what we have broken but with effort, eagerness and love, we can absolutely dig ourselves out of the hell we are now.

<br><hr>
I agree with your thoughts on Ken’s generation. I understand that the era was different and that people knew less back then about climate change. But it is truly egregious that the older generation, especially those with power, refuse to change once the problem gets worse. The reality of it is that anthropogenic climate change has been at a sustained record breaking high for the past few decades. 
<br><br>
It is also true that our own generation can participate and have a say in solving this crisis. Combating voter apathy and slacktivism is vital in making sure that our generation will slow down the terrible damage humans are doing to the earth. Our lifetime may not be enough to stop the change the previous generation caused, but we have to be willing to try.
<br><hr>
I agree about your opinion that the previous generation has been very irresponsible about climate change and ruined the environment the most out of everyone in this planet. You cannot deny that they has caused so many problems in this environment and the younger generation has to clean up the mess they have made since the past. However, I think it is time to move from blaming and encourage them and future generations to make a change all together. But anyways, I really love your passion and intake on the actions committed by past generations.

<br><hr>
While I agree with many of the things you say, I feel like many people are trying to make this into a generational issue. Like you said, we are just as liable for affecting the environment as the previous generation. Until the problem starts to see any signs of improvement, we will still have to face this grim reality. By blaming the older generation, many of us don't feel as nearly as much obligation to help as we should. It is quite unfortunate that many of those that control our legislatures are much older, and as a result, likely won't be swayed by our opinion. However, I think this is something we just have to accept and persevere through if we want to catalzye legitimate change. At some point, I believe it is hopeless trying to convince people that are stubborn in their ways.
<br><hr>
Thanks for your input! As I have mentioned early and in previous replies to my colleagues, we have to get over the fact that the last generation messed up climate change to certain extent. We need to forget about what they didn’t do and start doing what they should have done. We have everything in our power to change our future. Climate change is a universal problem that affects everyone on earth and I believe is in our best interest to keep our “home” safe and out of danger.
<br><hr>
This comment really stood out to me, with the obvious amount of passion and care for the environment really sucking me into reading the comment. Even though Ken's generation knew that fossil fuels are bad, they didn't know the extent of the consequences from their actions. That was forgivable. However, the fact that they know it now and continue their actions is unforgivable. This isn't everyone, just a huge part of this age group. Even with news about climate change and kids taking action, they refuse to believe it because believing it would mean taking the blame for every disaster that's about to happen. Knowing Ken is in this age group makes me respect him infinitely, for going against the leading opinions within his age group, and calling us to action. I agree with Octavio as I'm sure everybody else does, that we have to take action now. I also do not have a career headed towards climate change, but I will do my part and edit my lifestyle to create one that is much more environmentally friendly.
<br><hr>

I agree with you, we have to work collectively in order to stop the global temperature rise from reaching over 2 degrees Celsius. Kens generation have seriously left the planet at a bad for the next generation and the rest that follow. My only concerned is will we be able to get ourselves out of this situation? I only ask this because I see how people are all consumed by the new normal culture and the status quo. It will be difficult to convince everyone to cut back and think environmentally. Ken is right: the only change we can be able to make is through politics. We, as the younger generation, have to start showing up to the voting polls and out number the senior citizens who always show up when it comes to voting. I very much enjoy the saying: 'Knowledge is power only if acted upon'. It's true. Knowing all the issues in the world, they are still continuing despite claiming they should all stop, but why? That is why we all have to vote. Personally, I have never voted but I am seriously going to start #GOBERNIE

In the lecture video, ken talks about how the older generation not only were the main cause of the creation of the climate crisis but they are also not willing to help. Unfortunately these are the people who hold power in our country. They are denier of the situation they have made for our generation and just  create obstacles by preaching that the climate crisis does not exist. The evidence can be seen everywhere they look as weather becomes more drastic, sea level rises, and the amount of greenhouse gases rise in the air. Yet they fail to admit to they’re mistake. Older generations owe it to the new generations to help as much as they can and instead of creating obstacles help overcome the problem they have caused.

You mention that a majority of the undeveloped world has contributed little to the climate crisis, yet they will reap the worst consequences. I was wondering if you could expand on this point so as to get a better visualization of these consequences and why my generation should care. It may seem obvious to some, but I think it is important to understand how the consequences of our (the US) actions will impact so many others in a catastrophic way.

As Ken mentioned, the developing world produces significantly more Co2 than the developing world. In fact, as Ken mentioned, 95% of Co2 comes from the US, Europe, and Russia. Meaning developed countries are leading to more warming. However, not only are we causing this increased warming but the developing countries are the ones being more effected. Heres a few examples. Let's say California has a drought (like it has many times in the recent past). Instead of mass starvation, it was a toll on our economy because we simply imported more food and water from elsewhere. Somalia, on the other hand, is currently in the midst of a drought and is unable to import food and water due to its weak economy. For this reason, California's drought inconvenienced millions but killed very few, whereas in Somalia more than 2 million people are soon expected to face severe hunger. It boils down to the countries ability to handle the changing climate. Another example is hurricanes. Hurricane Katrina, the deadliest hurricane in US history killed 1,833 people. Although this was a truly devastating event, the US's solid infrastructure and our early warning technology prevented it from becoming an even worse situation than it was. The Bhola Cyclone occurred in Bangladesh and although it was SIGNIFICANTLY less powerful than Katrina, it killed between 300,000 and 500,000 because of their weak infrastructure and lack of preparation.

In this lecture video, many "maybe" surprised me letting me know that how nowadays people are not willing to admit that they caused climate change themselves. We should rethink of our life patterns and act against this warming trend otherwise it would badly influence our daily life and the environment we live in, that's what Ken reminds me of.  Considering people in undeveloped country, non-human life and children of people who caused this crisis, the issue, climate change is so important that it can be a factor that influence election in the future. The CO2 grows so fast in last decades and us contributes the most, so we are supposed to think about what we can act now.

I liked that this video went over why the older generation may be reluctant to consider climate change as a major issue. Someone's got to start making change happen though, and I'm glad that the younger generation is picking it up, otherwise I feel like it would be difficult to say that there is any hope at all for the planet. It's upsetting, like you said, that people in developing countries as well as non-human lives are the first to be impacted by big company greed and the consumerist society we live in. As individuals, we must vote in order to have our voices heard.

Due to the nature of how the effects of climate change comes about, the previous generations could not directly see the impact of their lifestyle on the climate. However the effects can be seen now and how anyone can just ignore everything that's happening is upsetting. There are still people that go out of their way to make choices that contribute even more to climate change. It doesn't even matter that they deny climate change but it seems they don't even care that they're affecting the lives of their future family.

For the longest time, despite the efforts of climate scientists and environmental activists, climate change has been largely viewed as an “out of sight, out of mind” issue. 
 <br><br>
I find it hard to hold a grudge against older generations because we would’ve looked for the same advancements, solutions, and luxuries popularized in the 20th century. No generation is less greedy, less eager for advancement, or lacking a desire for a higher standard of living than the generation that preceded it. This is evident in the booming technology industry popularized by our generation that supports affluent and rapid obsolescence of phones, computers, tablets, and other "smart" items. 
  <br><br>

I believe environmental activism is more popular within our generation because, since the turn of the century, we’ve seen the rapid onset of visible effects such as wildfires, strange weather, dying species, high-temperature statistics, and politics that affect our lives. A lot of this awareness stems from the popularity and availability of social media and exposure that past generations lacked. 
  <br><br>

As mentioned in the video lecture, the concerns of past generations, such as the Baby Boomers or Generation X, weren’t focused on prioritizing the earth’s wellbeing but instead focused on human health and livelihoods. Our generation realizes that both are inextricably linked to environmental issues within the climate crisis which provides hope for change in the future.

It did not surprise me at all that climate change was ranked so low in the top political issues in the United States. Before taking this class, I knew climate change was a problem, but definitely not to what extent. During winter break, I took part of a survey that questioned my stance on climate change. A lot of the beliefs I had then, are the same beliefs I have now about the climate crisis. However one stance I had that has changed the way I think about climate change was how much of an issue climate change is not only politically, but in all aspects. Originally in the survey I had taken during winter break, I ranked climate change as a top 5 political issue out of 12. However, after taking this course I am certain that climate change is the #1 "political" issue that we have at this time. Like other comments have described, it is important the the general population is educated about this issue that will impact our lifetime as well as the many generation after us. We need to somehow devise a clear and shorthand solution for the general public about how we can overcome and impede on what is to come with this climate crisis. The climate crisis must be viewed as a serious issue before any major changes occur within our society and we can do this by educating and spreading a message to the general public.

I agree with the video. I feel like the more youthful age is certainly more put resources into explaining our atmosphere emergency. The age that was associated with the modern unrest organize making benefit over helping the earth. The possibility that environmental change is a reality may not be credible to them. Environmental change is an issue that began inside 10 years, and the individuals who are more seasoned decide not to trust it. I do believe the past readings and videos make everything seem like we are going backwards, when in reality, yes it is bad and our planet is struggling but I do think that you aren't shedding light on the good things that are happening in the planet at the moment. Yes, focusing on the tragedies is good and important but its just as important to focus on the good.
  <br><br>
By steadily expanding the quantity of more youthful voters, we will tune in to increasingly splendid contemplations for sparing our planet and revolting the present conditions of "ecological refusal". What I truly like is the declaration of "making another world". We ought not consider simply do some minor fixes to the shaking structures. Or maybe, the world is sitting tight for us to have an exhaustive change to spare it.

I think you are spot on with your analysis of the generational gap over environmental activism. Looking at the facts, it is obvious that a huge challenge for older generations is taking ownership for the detrimental effects they’ve imposed through economic growth. The unusual time delay experienced by boomers and previous generations has quickly transitioned to a rapid doom. It’s ironic how smaller countries are put down for not being modernized, yet this modernization is what is killing the planet. The mindset of climate change deniers is beyond childish, because children are more accepting of truths that they don’t yet understand. 
  <br><br>
I especially appreciate how Ken moves through the points of denial and acceptance and poses the question of strategic action. Unlike many of his generation, Ken is working to educate and thereby arm upcoming generations with the knowledge to combat climate change. What resonated with me the most was the three groups of climate change victims he outlines. 
  <br><br>
Half of the modern world causing minimal amounts of climate change, innocent non-human life, and approaching generations are the biggest victims of climate change. Interesting how those causing harm the most will feel it the least. I think a large aspect behind this is how ideals of baby boomers don’t align with the good of our planet. This mindset is toxic for future generations, as the consequences of climate change worsen everyday. I love your take on possible solutions to begin to tackle this problem; it is this mindset that the rest of the world needs to adopt.

In the first lecture, Ken Hiltner tries to explain why his generation, the generation that is primarily at fault for the climate crisis, is simply not acting to resolve this problem. The way he put it in the most simplest terms was that it was a generational issue and that, “The older you are, the less urgent you will likely find the climate change.” This also combined with the fact that many of them are climate change deniers doesn’t make things any easier. What I’ve mostly obtained from most of the assignments is that Ken Hiltner’s generation was ignorant and selfish. Scientists at his time were warning people about the inevitable threat, but yet no one wanted to listen, and if they did, they would just ignore them. That’s not to say our generation isn’t selfish, but we do now have a better understanding of the problem, making us less ignorant than the previous generations. Though we are less ignorant, I do believe we have gotten more selfish than the previous generations with our excessive use of fossil fuel for the betterment of our personal lifestyles. 
   <br><br>
What I find really depressing is the fact that the ones that contributed very little to the climate crisis are the ones that will suffer the most. As you can tell there are many groups that should really upset such as children of the people that caused this mess and literally over half the world’s population that had minimal impact on the rise of CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Something in particular that I’m glad Hiltner mentioned that not only are humans are the ones that will be suffering, but also the non-human organisms that contributed literally nothing to the climate crisis. It’s quite sad and depressing to think about, especially to those that believe in ecocentrism. 
  <br><br>
 I began to notice throughout the videos that the reason why each year seems to be getting worse and worse is because all everyone does is talk the talk, and not walk the walk. I say this because of the Paris Accord that Hiltner brought up. He said that even after the Paris Accord, not only did CO2 emissions increase, they increased exponentially. What that really tells me is that many countries, ours included, don’t give enough of a fuck to do anything about this issue. They believe that signing an agreement is enough to make this whole situation magically disappear. What they need to understand is that that’s not how the real world works. The only way we can get even remotely close to tackling this problem is by working it out together as a team. No bickering, no arguing, no politics, none of that bullshit. Just plain old brainstorming, planning solutions, and fully committing to them afterwards with successful execution.

<p>
Professor Hiltner’s lecture has consolidated my understanding of the concept of “climate delay,” as he has emphasized in many other lecture videos as well. Due to the delayed nature of climate change, people from Professor Hiltner’s generation, the group which caused most of the environmental damage, did not fully understand our current problem. One point that struck me the most is saying that people from that generation have spent years in their lives without seeing any major consequences of a large amount of carbon emission, maybe just a few storms. They are, however, in deep denial of any factual information of climate change. Yes, they felt like their actions, their choices, and their lifestyles leave no harm to the environment; and no, the more and more frequent outbreaks of storms and other types of extreme weather conditions are already ringing the alarm bell for us all. Another heartbreaking point is the fact that there seems to be no effect policies or organizations to enforce the Paris Accord. When the Paris Accord was signed in 2015, the global carbon emission rate rises at 0.5% each year. But last year, by 2018, the rate is 2.7%, which is five times as much as 2015. This astonishing number just increased at a drastic rate throughout the period of just four years, which I almost don’t have a word to describe how I feel about this issue. It prompted me to question, why is there no effective enforcement, of climate agreements? Do the countries just sign the agreement and do not really make any changes? Paris Accord and Kyoto Protocol didn’t seem to stop our environmental problems from being mitigated. In fact, extreme cases are still rising at an alarming rate. Effective global monitor and enforcement on such issues is perhaps one key point for us to consider.

I too did not have a full grasp about the term "climate delay" until after it was thoroughly explained by Prof Hiltner. In fact, I have actually never even heard the term climate delay until this past year. I think the lack of mention of climate delay in the media(or at least the media I have been consuming) reflects the older generation's lack of interest in taking accountability for their actions and not wanting to make an active change to combat what is already happening due to the climate crisis. While of course there are people from the older generations, such as Prof Hiltner, who have taken responsibility and apologized for emitting so much fossil fuels into the atmosphere. However, I have only seen a small minority of older people apologizing. Come to think of it, it has only been older people I knew personally, such as professors and teachers, who have admitted their generation's role in the climate crisis. But, I have rarely seen that same sentiment from older generations on the media. 
       <br><br>
It sounds just cruel to think that older generations know what they did and that now the effects are starting to become visible now, and yet they do not care to fully acknowledge it or have a more active interest in making up for their wrongdoings because they know they won't really feel the full effect of it all. Do older generations really have that little concern for their children and their future children who will be the ones hurt by their actions? And even so, people should not only be concerned when it's only their children being affected, this same degree of concern should be held for all of humankind, regardless if they are related or not. It's a shame that our generation is the one that is going to have to pick up the pieces of our grandparents' mess.
<br><hr>

I'm glad you commented on the notion of climate delay as it is a good way to describe the numerous reasons we see inaction. However, as a personal note, I'll reserve usage of the phrase because it's probably something not many people will have heard. It is still a reality that plagues us to this day, evident by the statistic you quoted that emissions are - against all rationale - increasing! I am in a position where there is no time to spend weighing options; instead we must take radical action that the worst case scenario is a reality. We must also do our best efforts to truly live this lifestyle of consciousness for our planet and communicate it with our friends and family for we cannot do this alone.
       <br><br>

I agree that the biggest reason for inaction is greed and lack of accountability. To my understanding, businesses are legally treated as individuals in certain circumstances. This should be extended to the people responsible for reckless decisions. A party of people will inherently take more caution if they are aware that their complacency could end their career.

I want to start off this comment by saying that, 1. I do not want to be disrespectful as Ken is at least willing the talk about climate change which is more than I can say for most of his generation, and 2. He keeps saying that this class will get less "depressing" (i think a better word would be infuriating) so I am still holding out hope that in the next 8 weeks he will say something that will make me think this class has any value at all. That being said, I really dont feel the need to waste 30 minutes of my life watching two videos of a boomer explaining and reiterating the state of the climate crisis from a generational standpoint in a slow condescending voice topped off with a half smile . I find the title of this video extremely comical. There is no doubt in my mind why the boomers are not acting on the climate crisis or global inequality, the political state of this country, and any other issue that humanity faces today: they are the most selfish and corrupt generation in all of american history. I do not know what we as human beings did to deserve the pestilence that is the boomers but if there is some sort of cosmic fuckery thats pulling the strings my money is that it did not like world war 2. The fact is why they exist does not  really matter, but what they have done in their seemingly never ending life span does. Ken is constantly telling us that his generation is just checked out and it is our job to fix what they have done. Ok? Great, I think most of us would be perfectly willing to take over and try to reverse some of the damage done. The boomers, however, are so concerned with maximizing their last 20 years of life that they wont let us take power. They completely usurped  any voice or power of gen x so much so that they are litterally known as "the forgoten generation." They continue to do the same to the millineals insisting that those who are now in their 20s and 30s  are "ruining" this country. So rather than force us to watch another long winded apology video I would really appreciate it if ken would tell us how we, now the THIRD generation to try to take over for the baby boomers, are supposed to accomplish anything in a system that is entirly designed to serve one group of people and alienate the entire rest of the world including their own children. The concept that a life form would work to maximize the chances of survival for their offspring is the very foundation of life on earth, the fact that the baby boomers do not posses this quality -- that is so fundamental LITERALLY all life one earth is hardwired to respond to -- honestly scares the shit out of me.

This comment is a refreshing change from most of the others, even if I do not agree with all of the points made or the way they are being expressed. I appreciate Professor Ken's efforts to make changes and combat climate change, and being in this class for 2 weeks has already helped me decide to make significant changes in my life to help minimize my carbon footprint and combat climate change. However, the structure as of right now does not lend itself too much to creating new dialogue or discussing solutions. All of the commentary, even my own, seems to be filled with empty platitudes and writing a comment simply for the sake of getting the points in the class. I understand that the beginning of the course is supposed to be exploring the origin of the climate crisis and how we have not taken any action to combat this problem. However I think it would be helpful to explore the specific people and companies who have actively worked to profit at the expense of the world. Basically, it would be better to go from the general to the specific. Instead I feel like we are often learning about things that we already know, and little new information is being provided. For example, I think it is painfully obvious to everyone in my generation that the boomer generation is to blame for the climate crisis and that they are currently holding a majority of the power in government, yet I feel like these videos keep on repeating this same fact many times. I feel like much of the substance is repetitive. Similarly, when having 300 plus people writing in response to the same video, all of these comments seem to blend together and it is hard to see anything new. Of course, maybe Professor Ken will see this comment and highlight where I am misguided, and I look forward to that.


<br><hr>
First-off, I just want to say that I agree with everything you’ve said with no disrespect to Ken.The older generation should be held responsible for the damage they have done to the planet, and frankly it shouldn’t just be left up to the newer generation to fix a problem that was caused generations before us, if 70% of the U.S now understands that climate change exist, that means the older generation knows that what they are doing is destroying the planet, but since they are old and probably going to die soon they assume that we will be the generation to fix it. I don’t think our generation will be able to fix it when we live in a world where our government is consumed with greed and would rather drop billion of dollars on the military rather than on place that we call home.

I find it hard to listen to you sitting there apologizing for your generations mistakes. You are simply one man and you aren’t responsible for the climate hell hole that has been created. I think that we would benefit if more people of your generation felt this same way and with that same emotion, together there would be the traction of a generation, motivated to make a change. It would also be assumed that the huge generation that created the issue could band together to help our generation turn it around. 
       <br><br>

Unfortunately, young climate activists like Greta Thunberg, repeatedly get shot down by, again, the same generation that really left her with no choice. We are the generation that doesn’t get to experience the beauty of this planet like your generation did. We live in the shade of the fires and we cant go to see the largest reef in the world becuase it’s dead. And when we have acitivits like Greta standing up for the injustice that we, as a generation, have recieved, the brutal backlash from insecure middle aged men is appalling. Calling her a baby and ignoring her opinions when in reality she has more courage to speak up for a whole generation, calling for change, than the people throwing out petty disses via online social media.
       <br><br>

Instead of attacking the messenger, I believe the generation of deniers should have sound scientific reasoning to disagree with the arugments being set forth. Simply saying Greta is young is not an argument that promotes the bizzarre belief that climate change isn’t real. So while apologies are nice, actions are greater. And we would respect seeing the words turn to actions instead.

I agree. This apologetic nature of Professor Hiltner, although appreciated, is unwarranted as Ken didn’t singlehandedly cause the climate crisis. And even though his generation contributed the most to the crisis of any generation in global history, it is not necessarily ordinary Boomers who caused it. The real problem is the Boomers involved in the fossil fuel industries, in the technological industries, in the mass agricultural industries, the list goes on. 
<br><br>
It is truly unfortunate that the rich, mega-powerful elitists are destroying the planet for a quick buck, and do not care because they won’t be around to experience the utter hell on earth that may very well come about from climate change. They should care about their children, their future descendants, the planet they live on. Many of these Boomers are extremely religious. I’m curious as to whether or not they realize that their God would not appreciate them destroying the planet he created for them.

It is not surprising that global warming was ranked lower in concern among baby boomers compared to border security, terrorism, and immigration reform. Like Ken stated, a prominent reason for not believing in climate change is the fact that humans are not visually seeing the change in climate, and see it as no threat to their well being as of right now. The economic and social concerns I listed are more well-received to the public due to the fact that people are easily able to see the negative effects of such matters. For instance, border security has been a heightened concern for generations, and many families are impacted at a growing level. The same goes for immigration reform and terrorism—these are two topics that spark much controversy and debate amongst the public and numerous families. Basically, people are able to see the negative effects of what the government deemed as a higher concern, compared to not being able to see how climate change is impacting the earth and its inhabitants. A large majority of the global population, especially in the United States, is not able to process what really is happening to the climate because no substantial change is happening in their lives. When I say this, I mean nothing seems to be impactful enough to the average civilian to create considerable change in viewpoints, as well as make this crisis a priority.

It's incredibly frustrating to hear that some generations are more worried about terrorism and immigration over climate change. With terrorism being a problem, it definitely won't have even close to the same impact as the climate crisis will. The climate crisis is affecting all, old and young, left and right, developed and developing. Terrorism accounts for so little damage compared to the category 6 hurricanes, rising sea levels, and floods that the world is facing because of the climate crisis. 
<br><br>

The fact that the older generation is more concerned with immigration and terrorism says a lot: the older generation cares more about keeping America white rather than green. 
<br><br>

The underlying racism with both of these issues shows how ignorant the older generation is. We cannot allow them to act on our behalf; they are corrupt,  uneducated, hypocritical deniers. 
<br><br>

The younger generation needs to taker action, even a teenager like Greta Thunberg can make a large impact. One doesn't have to become as active as Greta Thunberg, simply not denying and voting is good enough to make a change. Hopefully we will be seen as the younger generation of the 60's, where they successfully fought for civil rights and for the end of the Vietnamese War.

<br><hr>
It is very true that the impact of climate change is much greater in scale in comparison to terrorism and immigration. This being said, these words are not a downgrade of concern for other growing issues, but a reality check of what is truly happening to the earth as we speak. The saying "slow and steady wins the race" from one of Aesop's fables "The Tortoise and the Hare" really falls into the issue of climate change because the earth is changing right before our eyes, yet many humans will not realize it until it is too late. In this case, the earth is the tortoise and the people of the world is the hare. In this story, the hare would always brag and boast about how fast he could run, leading the tortoise to challenge him in a race. The hare would end up taking several breaks in the course of the race, while the tortoise ended up winning because he never stopped. This resembles how climate change will never stop, regardless of what humans do. There is no stopping what is happening to the earth, but there are ways to sustain our earth if humans do not stop in this race towards saving our planet.

I agree with everything stated in the video. I feel like the younger generation is definitely more invested in solving our climate crisis. The generation that was involved with the industrial revolution prioritize making profit over helping the environment. The idea that climate change is a reality may not be believable to them. Climate change is a problem that started within a decade, and those who are older choose not to believe it. Why would they want to when it conflicts with their jobs? 
<br><br>
Oil and petroleum companies release so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, warming our earth and creating devastating environmental effects. Accepting that you contributed to climate change would make any one feel bad. That is why the older generation choose to view climate change as a "hoax" created by the younger generation. 
<br><br>
It provides them comfort to deny the problem rather than accept reality.

I agree and support what you have written here, Sophia. As you touched upon, the younger generation is the generation that is invested in climate change, not generations older than us. I also agree with the point you made that why would they want to believe in climate change when it would conflict with their jobs. How could we expect a whole generation to give up the security they have in their professions for a concept that is foreign to them, and seems like something that would take forever to actually happen? I think our issue with the previous generation is the denial they are in about the effects. They built their livelihoods off of destroying the environment (oil, etc.) and is it hard to step away from a lifetime of hard work just because some young environmental activists told them to. That being said, I think it is a refreshing thing to see how helpful and motivated our generation truly is when it comes to climate change. Even the idea that we have a class devoted to the climate crisis says a lot about how times are changing, and it makes me hopeful that someday the older generation will look back and say thank goodness for the millennials who saved the Earth!


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. The younger generation is much more invested in combating the climate crisis for a multitude of reasons. First off, with social media the younger generation has been able to grow up more educated due to the widespread climate activism that constantly ends up going viral. In addition, I think the Ken’s generation has failed to act on the climate crisis for similar reasons. They were not educated on the perils of climate change because it was not as serious of a topic then. There is also just more evidence supporting climate change now where as 50 years ago the studies were not as concrete making them easier to deny. As the years go on, the younger generation will continue to become more active in combating climate change simply because it will affect more of their lifetime.

The older generations should be held responsible for the damage they've caused the planet. What concerns me is that, as you said, 70% of people in the US now believe climate change is happening due to human actions. This means that older generations are knowingly destroying the planet that their kids will inhabit, and doing nothing about it. I thought the purpose of living was to create a better life for your children. All of history has been about parents improving the lives of their kids. It now seems like we are going backwards. I have even talked with my own grandparents, who say they are unable to care about the climate change. One note of interest, however, is that they have made environmentally conscious decisions: not because they care about the environment, but because it was financially beneficial. They currently live in Norway, where electric car owners are rewarded with massive tax deductions and driving pollutive cars is very costly. This brings me to the point you made in the other lecture video. Changing policy will change the actions of older generations who do not necessarily care. We don't have to convince older people to care about the environment if we can make being environmentally conscious line up with their own personal reasons. After you mentioned that older generations have twice as much voting power, I understood that voting is massively important for changing the world we live in. I think the first step we as a generation can take is create a culture that encourages voting to a much higher degree.

I think the difficulty Ken trying to say here is some people either do not care about this problem or the area they lived or themselves can not seethe great effect of the global warming. I also believe so and the difficulty is we need to figure out a method to let them alert and make changes about this deteriorating issue.

Although the time delay aided the climate crisis, I still believe that the ignorance of choosing not to believe those who know exactly what they are talking about, those with years of knowledge and experience, the scientists, is astonishing and the only reason for the climate crisis we have today. Why are people in such deep denial? I agree with Ken that it is because what has been done is unthinkable but yet, it does not need to be imagined because it is right in our face. The United States just cannot seem to take ownership of anything. I have lost all my patriotism and am even ashamed to come from this place. The climate delay sounds horrifying because it can almost feel as if that is where we are heading towards. I see more and more people each day becoming aware of the importance of taking care of the Earth but I do not know that there is enough action being taken place since it is mostly my generation who wants to make that change. The older generation who still cannot seem to wrap their heads around the issue present, literally, are the ones in power. The Earth’s and our survival is in their hands, a bunch of older white males who are run by the color green. That is a scary reality.

I agree with your viewpoint and appreciate the passion that you have for the issue. The older generations a lot of times look to articles that align with what they think should be happening. They look to people who confirm that they didn't create this catastrophic issue and therefore they have nothing to fix. I would not go as far as to say that I am ashamed to live in this country, because I am not. I am ashamed of the way that some people have used their political power and ashamed that the people have let it happen, but there is always hope for change, especially with our generation very quickly taking over these issues. We can't change what's already happened, and we can't change people's minds overnight about the issue, but we can push for change and push for a better future for ourselves. We will be the generation facing most of the repercussions, so naturally, we care more. I see our generation being the ones to fix this and to vote in people who will listen to the concerns and will make a difference. We know that in Ken's generation 3/4 of the CO2 was put into the atmosphere, and we know the 2/3 of it is from us, but let's move past that. Most people didn't understand the severity of what they were doing, and some refuse to accept it now, but we know and we can make the change. Let's move on from blaming generations and pointing fingers at each other as if it's some sort of political issue. This is not political. Our planet is not political. We all need to get on the same page and start making a change. We need action, not more arguing.

The climate crisis is just like slow poison. It is getting serious secretly. It is hard for everyone to notice that. Some discover it and want to change it with their effort, while others think it is not harmful or pretends not seeing it. Part of the deniers are really unknown about the climate problem, while some deniers know the truth but still want to hide it from the public. It is because the solution to the climate crisis will harm the profit of some people in high status. They don’t desire the change, since it may affect the rule of the world to a large extent. Just like the video said, the main deniers are around 60 years old. Since their life will not affect by the consequence of climate crisis, a slow poison that will largely influence the future generation, they don’t want to suffer their own profit to figure out the problem that will not punish their own individual life. It is had to change their stubborn mind and let them know their responsibility for the future. However, the good news is more and more my generation have a concept about the climate crisis and understand the serious result behind it. Therefore, I believe when my generation leads the world, the climate crisis will get more attention.

Comparing the climate crisis to a slow acting poison is a very interesting analogy and I completely agree with what you said. People continue to pollute the environment because there is no immediate effect from the damage we are doing to the planet. Because the effects of our carbon emissions are delayed, we don’t see the problem until it is too late. This allows people to believe that their actions have no direct repercussions and will in no way impact them. Even when people finally do see the effects of their actions, they do little to change or stop it. It is easier for some in the older generation to carry on with their lives and pretend nothing is wrong. Some may even have the mentality that it is not their fault and even if they did cause this problem, it is not their priority as they won’t be around for much longer to face the repercussions of their actions.

<br><br>

Large corporations, especially those invested in fossil fuels, have a lot at stake if everyone were to believe in climate change. Fossil fuel industries would lose enormous amounts of money and it is sad to say, but there are people in the world who care more about themselves and their own self interest than how they might be negatively impacting people in third world countries. This is the same with politicians who are easily swayed by said corporations and industries. They are paid to deny the existence of climate change and in turn influence their followers to do the same.

<br><br>

I also agree that there is still some hope left for our planet. Our generation is becoming more aware of the situation and involving themselves through acts of protests and demonstrations. We, as a generation, are trying to limit the impacts of the issue mainly caused by our predecessors. As a whole, we are bringing more attention to the issue of climate change and becoming the change that the world so desperately needs.

I think that the previous generation has been more in denial about the rise of climate change because a lot of big businesses exploded with he expense of the environment during their times. Because of this, the value of their successes has overshadowed the cost on the environment. Therefore, it is more likely that they feel less pressure to help the environment as all they have known so far is the boom of the big businesses. I think that this is unfortunate as they prioritized their profits over the environment fo the future generations. Additionally, the thought of preserving a world for the future generations seems less tangible as the older generations may not be around for long enough to see just how drastic the climate crisis is.

I would absolutely agree. I believe that the generations before us have been blinded by the monetary success of the fossil fuel industry and the comfort it has brought to their lives. Why try to change habits if you are going to die so soon anyways? I suppose that what is the most frustrating about this inaction is that this generation fought so hard in their early days and supported more radical ideas. This generation brought about the modern environmental movement in the 1970s, they fought for civil rights, and protested the Vietnam war. I can only wonder how such a large portion of people who once supported progressive ideals has now shrunk so much. I think that there should be some level of solidarity from older generations for the plight that we face. Our struggle is no different than those that they faced, so why is there no support? Possibly its because of the American message of individualism or the ever looming demand of capitalism that has caused them to only focus on themselves. I can only hope that in the future these older generations come about and realize their faults, or that they step aside before we force them to do so, so that progress make finally be achieved.

I agree with you on the conflicts between environment and economic costs, which can explain the denial, the negation of reality, as opposed to ignorance. Those people glimpse the horrible reality, but choose to defend themselves against it. Perhaps they have not realized the long-term effect of climate change. Maybe if the younger generation try to have conversations with them on this issue, there is a possibility that intergenerational learning can change the opinion of some people.

It is staggering to me that climate change is still allowed to be worsened by fossil fuel corporations. Sure, at first we may have not known that burning fossil fuels was bad for the environment. Yet, in this day and age, we know very well what the consequences of climate change are, and nothing is being done about it. It is ridiculous how these fossil fuel corporations that are a huge problem to the climate crisis deny that climate change is real in order to make a quick profit. 
<br><br>
Climate change is an issue that needs to be acted on now. It can no longer wait as it is getting worse over time. However, a huge problem is that the older that a generation is, the less alarmed or concerned they are when it comes to climate change. The problem with this is that these older generations are the ones in power, the ones that are needed to make change. Despite the overall population believing in climate change more and more, sadly this doesn’t matter if we can’t get the older generations in power to make changes. 
<br><br>
However, we can’t wait for that to happen. We need to make changes now. We need to vote. And I agree very much with this as I know a lot of people that don’t bother to vote, or only vote on presidential elections which in and of itself is not doing anything major to help the climate crisis. We are also being outvoted by the older generations which, as previously mentioned, are less concerned by the climate crisis. We need to act now, as the longer we wait the worse that this problem becomes, and the more difficult it becomes to resolve.

It is very frustrating to hear that most of our leaders are from a generation that mostly denies the existence of a climate crisis. However, this is information that was not new to me at all. It is easy to see that our government leaders are negligent in their approach toward global warming issues. It is the very reason why we have this class. Of course, the responsibility does fall upon younger generations. However, what scares me is that it is not the younger generation approving what big oil corporation gets to destroy the earth or how urgent we should be in an environmental regulation bill. One thing that did surprise me was that millennials did not consider climate change a top issue. That is even more disappointing, considering they are the ones that will come to power after the boomers are gone. It is disheartening and saddening to realize that these previous generations are allowed to wreck as much havoc as possible before leaving their mess to us. It is even more sad to realize that they still are not done making a mess.

I agree with you that it is frustrating to face the fact that the leaders still in power and that can enact change are exactly the people who caused this crisis and are vehemently denying the issue. I also agree on you comment that this video did not provide us with much new information. Beside the fact that he mentioned millennials/Gen X did not rank climate crisis much higher in importance than baby boomers, I really felt that this video consisted of a repetition of mostly what we had already learned. However, maybe repetition isn't a bad thing. Repeating the devastating facts of climate change can stamp the horrifying numbers into our brains. 
<br><br>
In addition, his next video (part 3) also did not fully detail and elaborate on what steps the younger generation could do to solve this crisis. All that was mentioned included taking power. But how? I do believe that Prof. Hiltner will likely spread out the solution over time, throughout this series, and slowly ease us all into his radical suggestion. By the end of the whole series, I think we will all become more knowledgeable in mitigating the crisis.

It is true that a lot of the people and especially the older generations, the reasons why so many of them are not taking the issue seriously because for most part of their lives they don’t see a huge impact or consequences caused on them or even incidents such as flood, fire,etc happen and they didn’t personally experienced it, or they don’t know and didn’t feel how bad it can actually be. Many people especially those take use of fossil fuels to make money are denying human actions and the research given by the scientists. People don’t want to admit that they are the one causing the climate crisis ,they don’t want to admit that the use of fossil fuel have impacts on our environment which might make them los the chances to make huge amount of money, affect their power in the congress, government or making policies.
<br><br>

It is sad that to see how the people in older generations created most of these problems. I am not here to blaming those generation but because I do think they should admit and recognize the problem and to act to protect and save the planet as building up a good image to show they realize the problem and want to take action to correct their mistake now. Which on the other hand can actually encourage the younger generation and their people at the same age to address the issue seriously. The problem of climate crisis might not be the worst now but we do all see how environment and climate have been changing and the bad impacts they have caused on our and the other non-humans’ life.

It's honestly very sad and disheartening that much of the older generation completely disregards climate change, seeing as it has never affected them, and failing to take into account that it is and will only continue to affect their grandchildren and so on. When my grandpa, who is in his late 70s, told me flatly that climate change isn't real, and that I shouldn't believe in it either, I really was unsure how to react. Thinking back to the moment there are a lot of things I should have said but did not due to the shock I felt, however I feel that he is a prime example of an old white man, just like most of our government, who are a large part of the problem just like you said. As Ken mentioned in his second lecture video, it is essential that while we try to take the power into our own hands and make fundamental change, we should also try to educate our parents, and possibly even grandparents with what we have learned about the dire effects of climate change, and what will happen if we don't act now.

In the first of two lectures this week Ken talks about climate deniers and continues to expand on this idea that the previous generations are largely responsible for the climate crisis we find ourselves in today. I like how it is pointed out in this lecture that those in the previous generation are the ones who hold power today, especially in regards to the United States. I will look at congress meetings, they are streamed live, and all I see are a bunch of old, and largely male, senators. Of course many of them are not as concerned about climate change and the countless environmental problems that are occuring as a result - they will not face the reality we are headed towards, but we will as we get old and so will our children. I find this lack of perspective held by so many politicians in the developed world to be selfish and biased towards rich and powerful fossil fuel corporations who fund countless campaigns. I want to better understand how we can really create change with older politicians who still hold office today. Eventually we those from our generation will begin to hold office in these important seats and will be more concerned with this pressing issue, but, like Ken says, we need to act now. What else can we do to shift the focus of American politicians of past generations towards climate change?

I agree with your opinion in terms of the ones who hold power today are the people from the previous generation. I think that is the biggest obstacle we face in present day even though most of us understand the consequences of climate change. However, our actions are so miniscule in comparison to the legislation. The Earth needs our continuous support but also our power to vote for those politicians that believe in fighting climate change with us. The damage that has been caused cannot be reversed but at least we can try to alleviate it and prepare for the future. These “older politicians,” as you pointed out, are also the ones that are receiving direct financial benefits from “rich and powerful fossil fuel corporations.” It’s difficult to shift their views when they are so focused on the monetary exchange. I believe that in the next few decades, things could potentially become better if we elect the right personnel into office to represent our voice.
<br><br>

I understand the difficulty for those who believe in climate change and having to fight against even local business interests. I hope we can find a happy medium even if we don’t receive most benefits for a better living situation in terms of financial issues. There will be more jobs but there is only one planet for us. Even the focus on economy can be tied to climate change, by having a sustainable living, we could potentially save more money.

What Ken said about the three groups least responsible for anthropogenic greenhouse emissions- third world countries, non-humans, and the younger generations- suffering the most from climate crisis is incredibly sad. Although many activists, such as Greta Thunberg, have stepped up, the fact is that much of the people in charge of the institutions that can actually make a significant difference past awareness are part of older generations. Like Ken said, people in those older generations were raised in a different time with different morals, morals that are expiring at the same acceleration as the deterioration of the climate. Thereby, those people at best do not prioritize the planet’s health. At worst, they don’t believe in the reality of climate change. Although many argue against villainizing the older generation, I personally think that there is no need to spare feelings when there are millions of humans and non-humans suffering through consequences like the melting icebergs and the natural disasters. Additionally, I think the extent to which older generations owe to the rest of the world is to take responsibility for their actions, and use their power to initiate change. However because they have failed to do so, there is justification to point fingers at their inaction.

you hit the nail on the head when u were discussing how fair it is that many in power do not care for the climate at all. Our generation is the one that understands this issue the most, cause we are seeing everything in front of us: death of our coral reefs, species dying, rising temperatures, and rising incidences of crop blight around the world. Even in our own backyard, the fires of California are all examples of climate change. The clock is ticking on the chance we have to reduce the effects of climate change, as everyday more and more carbon emissions are being released. As stated in the lecture video, even after the Paris climate agreement, emissions still went up 5-fold. Even having a groundwork and plan was not enough. Actual action through law, and being in control of future decision, will be the way we can make difference. Day to Day personal choices, including a life of veganism, but ultimately the power of corporations and big business is responsible for the most emissions. Holding them in check will be viable, as well our own personal effects on the environment, for the future of this planet. Luckily, there are more people like Greta caring for the environment in our generation than not. We are on the right track.
<br><hr>
I agree that we have to do our day to day part to lessen the effects of climate change, I feel like there should be a bigger push on corporations who are in the business of making money. The incentive behind making money through oil is that there is already infrastructure behind products that utilize oil. It is so much cheaper to continue using oil in their industries than to change it up for something else. The right incentives are important to have the person in charge to stop using oil especially if they are of the older generation. Another option is to have the person in charge be replaced by a younger person who sees the severity of the situation. They will already have the incentive to change since they know that they will live through the worst.

I agree that the reason older generations do not consider the climate crisis a priority is because of the delayed effects of pollution.  If I had been polluting the planet for decades and I have not seen any consequences of my pollution, why should I believe that the events that began recently were the result of something I had been doing for such a long time?  It is difficult for the older generation to accept climate change because it conflicts with something that they had believed in for such a long time.  Furthermore, them accepting climate change would mean that they are accepting blame for something that is destroying the planet. 
<br><br>

I also agree that the only way for humans to stop and reverse what we have done to the planet is to put the younger generation in charge, as we are the generation that prioritizes the environment.  However, this is a difficult goal because there are other matters of importance besides environment.  As a student currently in a class where I learn about the climate crisis, it is obvious that I would feel that we should prioritize the environment over everything else because the climate crisis is something that will affect the entire planet.  But, there are other issues besides the climate crisis that affects us that we must also prioritize.  
<br><br>

Younger people might find it weird that older people do not accept climate change, but that is because for most of our lifetime, we have experienced the effects of climate change.  We can accept that climate change is real because that is our reality, we do not know of a life where pollution was done without being made aware of the consequences of pollution.

I always find it unfathomable how so many members of older generations are able to blatantly ignore facts provided by scientists that prove the existence of climate change. Climate change is very real; we are already able to see its effects on our country, and yet, many simply do not believe that it exists. It seems that today, my generation as well as millennials are more concerned about climate change and focused on it as an important issue. Why is there such a gap in action between generations? The answer is simple, older generations are given the choice to believe or not believe in climate change because for them, it is not an immediate threat. They are past the peaks of their lives and have no need to be concerned about the future. This is particularly unfortunate for the younger generations because the concern of those older generations is necessary. They are our current leaders, and the laws they choose to pass or not pass today could have a huge affect on the lives of future generations. 
<br><br>

Our generation does not get to choose whether or not to “believe” in climate change because we will be living through it. We will not be able to ignore it like these older generations can. It is very frustrating to realize the weight of the issues that were not caused by us but will punish us eventually. The choice to ignore the issues that younger generations will be forced to face is why older generations are not acting as much as they should be.

I understand your frustration about how the older generations are completely ignoring the facts that scientists have presented them, because I feel the same way. But, after watching this lecture video I kind of understand why these generations are ignoring it. Professor Hiltner mentions that most of them are, in fact, in a state of denial. I feel like they deep down know that this is an issue, but they know that if they begin to believe in the climate crisis that they will have to take the blame and responsibility for it. And, don’t get me wrong I totally think they should take the blame, but that is a lot of responsibility to carry with you and by them choosing to ignore the issue makes it to where they don’t have to be held accountable for their actions in their lifetime by simply denying that it is a problem. 
<br><br>

However, there are obviously some older people like Hiltner that recognize this is an issue because he is thinking about future generations and how it affects their lives. It’s very self-centered for some people in the older generations to ignore this issue because it won’t affect them in their lifetime. 
<br><br>

Personally, I feel so helpless because I do want to do something to save the planet and I do want to vote but how can I be sure that that is enough? I feel like by all of us voting, there is still a toss up of whether that will work or not because we don’t know exactly who will get elected through the popular vote. I just wish there was more that all of us could do and that it isn’t too late.

When I talk about the age divide between the younger generations and the boomers, what is so central to my argument for why the divide is good is because the boomers will just never get it. They can go to Florida and die before it goes underwater. They can go to Palm Springs and lay out in the sun before the heat will start killing people. They can go to Las Vegas and gamble away a fortune made on the backs of exploiting the global south while the water slowly runs out. We are better off fighting them tooth and nail and yelling "ok boomer" at every word they say because, in my eyes, they are the ones most responsible for the death and destruction and war that climate change will inevitably lead to. It does no good to humor them because all of the issues that they find more pressing, especially immigration and terrorism, are CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. 

<br><br>

The boomers are stuck in their old habits and shitty ways and they could not have grown up in a more different country. We owe them nothing and have a responsibility to ensure they do not control our future. I would sooner join a eco-terrorist group then be content with the tagline that we just need to "spread awareness" about climate change to a population subject to several global misinformation campaigns.

 I totally agree with the point you brought up. The climate crisis producers are divided into two parts in our world: old generation and the younger generation. The younger generation normally accept better education, so most of them the know the disadvantages of the climate crisis and the importance of protecting our environment. The older generation are those who have power in their hand. like the professor claim that those who work in the Supreme Court, government, and the leadership core of each each companies. So the point is these guys are in charge of the policy making in our government. They always ignore the importance of protecting the environment. It's important to let everyone realize that the environment problems is a big problem for our next generations. It's not a problem that we don't suffer any cost from the climate crisis, but what will our next generation face in the future? The crazy revenge of the nature, tornado, tsunami, eruption of volcano, earthquake... people let's start now, protect our environment and get more and more people involved with us.
<br><Hr>

True! Many people don't know that climate change has a time delay. They thought global warming or whatever extreme weathers are caused by our younger generations. However, those boomers are criminals. Meanwhile, those older generations didn't act not only because they didn't realize what they've done, but because they are quickly going to die(sorry it's mean). I can actually know what they are thinking about climate change: the life for us is limited, the climate change will not affect me during my lifetime, the future problem is not related to me, I should enjoy the rest of my life instead of doing something that will only see the change after I died. Those people didn't care about the future because they didn't have a "future". 

<br><br>

Other than that, like what you said in the second paragraph, the boomers' habit is hard to change. They grew up with those old habits, so they can't just change it immediately. Meanwhile, we can't ask them to do the same thing as the younger generation. We grew up with climate change, so we receive how to protect Earth every second as we lived. However, those boomers didn't.

<br><Hr>
I completely agree with you. Although your comment is harsh, it remains true. We need to stop hoping the older generation is suddenly going to change their minds and decide to tackle this urgent issue. They’ve lived the same way for decades so why would they change their habits now. If this issue is only becoming apparent now, at the end of their lifetime, and they will remain for the most part unaffected by it, why would they care? Even if they were to come to grips with what they’ve done, or more so what they haven’t done, such a realization is going to take time. And time is simply something we can’t spare any longer.
<br><br>

I believe the only way for things to change is that one, younger people need to be put into office, and two, climate change can no longer be a political debate. Since the only way for legislation to pass is if both major parties agree, and since the majority party in both houses of Congress and the president are never part of the same party and never agree, progress can’t be made. People need to realize that political parties and climate change are two completely separate issues that shouldn’t be creating such dilemmas. Climate change is the cause of so many of the world’s problems, as you said, and it’s only the beginning. 
<br><br>

The problem with having the older generation predominantly in office is that, not only are they indifferent to this rapidly growing problem, but they also have very different intentions. They believe climate change isn’t as important as other issues, which fundamentally isn’t true. We need people with high government positions who are young and have grown up hearing about this problem, we need people who feel the threat of the issue and truly care. Furthermore, when it comes to CEOs who are in charge of huge and important corporations, especially those over the age of 50, they have completely different motives. Their desires center purely around making money, and they will do almost anything they can to obtain as much of it as they can, completely disregarding how their actions affect the earth. We need people to start prioritizing climate change, and to start putting effort into the issue.

Ken, although I agree wholeheartedly with all that you have said in this video, I feel like I learned nothing new. Everything you discussed in this video, you have already mentioned several times in your other videos, word for word. As someone who is very interested in this issue and is paying close attention to your lectures, it is a bit frustrating to hear you beat this dead horse. Yes, we get it. The previous generation should have acted, there is no time to continue arguing, three-quarters of our CO2 was added during your generation, we are responsible for two-thirds of it... I get that you are trying to apologize for your generation and show that we need to act because your generation will not, but this obsessive repetition of a basic idea in almost every lecture is simply frustrating and, in my opinion, draws away from the importance of your argument.

<br><br>

With that said, I want to address some of the points in your sister video, how our generation can take action. I agree and realize that we have to take power. My question or request is if you could please explain more in detail how. Because of things such as corporate lobbying and long terms for senators and representatives, this issue is not as simple as 'oh let's get more people to vote.' Even after taking AP government, I feel like I still don't have a clear idea of how our political system works. I feel like this movement needs someone not politically affiliated to devise a plan for strategic elections. From the point of an uneducated, average college student, you seem like the perfect candidate. 

<br><br>

We need someone to make a plan like, oh we should elect these 2 representatives because even though they are not likely to pass new measures, they would most likely reject the upcoming nomination of a judge who would probably rule in favor of an oil company. What I'm saying is that given that politics is all about compromise, we are very unlikely to be able to elect representatives who will overwhelmingly vote for a clean-cut end to the fossil fuel industry next election. We need someone to plan out all of the Domino pieces so that we may work towards our goal step by step.

I agree with the aspect of your comment regarding the political nature of climate change. If we can all agree that climate change does not boil down to something that needs to be a political issue, then we can affectively begin to plan the next steps. Personally speaking, I believe that many people are too focused on the political activism side of enviromentalism and climate change rather than taking steps to tackle the issue themselves head on. Obviously not everyone has the resources to take proper steps to fight climate change and that is why people turn to political heads to fund the change needed, but it goes too far when we are stuck arguing about the politics of climate change. Climate change is not stopping for anyone or any conversation. It progresses as we speak and until immediate action is taken and differences are ignored, I do not think that climate change will be solved. Unless we as a collective humanity decide to take the necessary steps to tackle the issue, how can the entire planet be saved? I appreciate your comment because it points at the weak links in our society, which is relying too much on the government to take action rather than taking that action ourselves with the freedom we fortunately are granted.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. After so many classes, we already have a deep understanding of the causes of environmental crisis, the hazards of it, and the reasons for not improving. A simple explanation, voting, really can't solve the problem we face. In other words, we need details. How to vote? To what? What we need to pay attention to? etc. In addition, Western culture is deeply rooted in people’s minds. It will take a lot of time to stop them from buying products to obtain happiness. Also, changing consumer culture is against all companies. We need a long-term plan to make it possible. However, we still don’t know how to do it.
<br><br>


In my opinion, Ken won't be a person who will surely make us successful, but at least, he can give a general explanation and plant a seed in students' hearts. There are 800 students in this class and I believe that there will always be students who will engage in political work when they grow up, and these seeds will take root and sprout at a suitable time, produce positive influence, and improve the situation.

<br><br>

At last, I like the simile of Domino pieces. The function of voting or things like changing culture can't be achieved overnight. It needs time, even a century.

<br><hr>
 I totally agree with everything you've said, many of us are first time voters because we've just come of age and are uniformed on the policies and leaders that have direct affect or can create direct change on this topic matter. There needs to be more focus on the present and steps towards the future rather than an apology for the past.
<br><br>
I think Ken is doing all he can do to be a platform that is spreading awareness of this topic for us to take on and fix. He also is doing his part in what he can to help the climate, by owning very few, only 30 clothes, having the same shoes for 7 years, riding a motorcycle, and having his house be solar power based. I think he can improve on guiding us with more detailed steps, however when voting and politics come into play, it can become very difficult to relay correct unbiased information.
<br><br>
Lastly, I also believed that even if our generation starts now, we won't see true changes until the end. of the century, and I think this concept needs to be accepted and not overlooked. I feel as though we can save the world but even with action being taken now it will take time.
<br><hr>
I absolutely agree with you. The most powerful approach we can take towards saving the planet is a political one. If our very own representatives and government administrators fail to acknowledge the dramatic changes the planet is going through, we cannot advance. Hence it is of paramount importance to get this message to ignite action among the government. I also liked the part where you said that we have to get this done step by step.

<br><hr>
I fully agree with your comment. After listening intently during every lecture as well as each lecture assignment, it has reached the point where the "my generation is not taking any action towards remedying the climate crisis" comment has become somewhat of a vain assertion. Although it is important for the older generation to recognize their faults,  I agree that this has grown into an "obsessive repetition of a basic idea."

With the planet becoming a much more progressive, you would think that world leaders, famous people, or anyone would start taking more action to prevent climate change. Sure, don't get me wrong, Leonardo DeCaprio did a great job opening the eyes of viewers on the dangers of climate change, and there are people that genuinely care about our planet's current state. But why has there been little effort to changing the planet's direction of extinction? Because world leaders that ACTUALLY have a chance of changing the world are ignorant and in complete denial of climate change. One of example is when Donald Trump made a comment on how cold it was one time at a speech of his and question if global warming was real because it was so cold outside. The ignorance that is shared in people won't lead us in a great direction. We need someone who is educated and can make a change.

I completely agree with your discussion and believe that leaders and politicians need to begin changing our energy habits before the the impacts of climate change are felt around the world. If the US were to take a stance against carbon emissions, specifically switching to more sustainable energy sources, I believe other countries would start to follow suit. Without powerful, developed countries making changes, many developing countries will follow in the footsteps of developed countries who revolve around a network of petroleum products. Truly sad

It is quite interesting that people tend to believe what favors their actions and are very easily to be over optimistic. Many people in the generation that caused two thirds of global carbon emission have benefited such a great deal from high-carbon-emission lifestyle that they unconsciously make every effort to deny the truth that the climate change has been abnormal and unnatural. Factories that benefit the most from fossil fuels are even more unlikely to admit that they are receiving profit at the cost of environment damage. The gradual changes of climate are barely noticeable without scientific observations, making it even more difficult for people to acknowledge the existing crisis. Honestly, when I think of the severity of the climate crisis, I still felt unbelievable that the climate change might someday cause the mass extinction of human being and probably most species on the planet, given that I do care about environment. It just seems so far away. However, after listening to the recent lectures, I realized that the crisis is critical. It is crucial to teach people who are still making excuses for themselves having little to do with the climate change to step out of their original ideas that keeps them comfortable and face the truth. 
<br><br>

It is irritating to see that the people who are releasing the highest proportion of greenhouse gases and suffered relatively little from climate change speaking that they are not responsible. It’s like someone smoking in a hospital and saying that he doesn’t feel the air bad. Every time when I think of the polar bears, I feel upset and guilty. Polar bears have done nothing wrong, they have been thriving at the north pole for more the 130 thousand years, until recent decades when carbon emission due to human activities increases uncontrollably. They did nothing wrong, yet they suffer from global warming the most. The diverging ice layers separate their colonies and cuts down the number of their food source, seals. What causes these are human activities, and I suppose anyone who is watching this lecture contributes a little to global warming. Not just the factories or the governments, no one is not responsible for the crisis. I think it would be wise to find problems from ourselves and reduce as much as carbon emission from our daily life, starting from our generation.

I used to believe that the elder generation who has vast power in the society did care a lot about the climate change and such issues around it. However, after I watched this video, I never thought that they would care even less than children or teenagers. Those people who have the power to do something for our future, in contrast, did the tiny part in it. When I saw that the scientists believe that these results are actually caused by malfunction of machine or wrong modeling, or using any excuse to believe that this is not caused by human, or it is not serious. I just don't understand why are they doing this. Who are they fooling? Us? No, only themselves. As a college students we can personally sense that our home, Earth is sick, and it is continuing getting worse and worse. We must do something to prevent the conditions getting worse. Without our home, where we shall live?

I agree with your statements. Those who have the power, money, and resources to influence others to take action against climate change refuse to do so. They prioritize making money rather than helping the earth.

Even though the past generation cannot take all responsibility for the climate crisis, it’s our, the younger generation, thoughts and concepts that can influence each other. According to the Paris Accord, “The goal is to reduce emissions to between 80-95% of the levels that we had thirty years ago, back in 1990.” Since technology has become more advanced now, it’s inevitable to reduce CO2 emissions due to the great amount of use of transportations and cars. However, it’s essential to make the public or younger generations be aware of the impacts of how CO2 affects our environment and the phenomenon of global warming. Planning ahead of time can not only support future generations living in a more comfortable and secure situation but also can make our world a better place without huge concerns.

It frustrates me so much that there are still such a large amount of people who deny the changing climate. Despite the countless statistics and facts from scientists across the world, people are still convinced this is a non issue. I blame the spread of fake news through social media. If you go on twitter and search for the world climate change, you can find countless articles and posts from accounts claiming to be a reliable source spewing out misinformation and false stats. Another issue is greed. Fossil fuel companies care more about lining their pockets and don't mind seeing the world suffer for it. I have faith in my generation and hope that as we get leadership positions in the workforce, we can make a impact and do our best to make a livable world for the future generations.

I agree. As the global climate change had already triggered serious problems towards our environment and there are already people who live in poor countries suffer a lot from it, it is frustrating that there are still denial of the climate change. Those people think that climate change is not an issue that is worth to concern. Some of they deny the fact because they do not actually bear the consequence of environmental damage while the bad storms and wild weather are considered normal. Some of they think that the scientists’ instruments or models might be wrong, or it is just a natural cycles of climate which is not caused by human beings. The video seems to convey the information that global warming is a real and urgent issue that needs the younger generation to react to protect the environment.


<br><hr>

I agree as well; I also think that it’s absurd people are stating the most puzzling reasons to deny the climate crisis and admit that it is an anthropogenic issue. The developing world has already placed 3/4th of all greenhouse gases emissions into our planet’s atmosphere, and yet they are still denying climate change. Ken mentioned how some believe that the rise of temperature or the increasing frequency of natural disasters has always been part of nature, or simply view these as part of the natural cycle of climate. Others deny climate change because they accuse scientists of falsifying their data, or perceive them as corrupt and moneymakers. 
<br><br>
It’s truly sad that many people of the older generation are ambivalent and indifferent to this issue, and according to Ken, particularly those that are older than 40. The developing world is putting greenhouse gases into our atmosphere every single day, yet it is up to the younger generation to clean up the mess.

<br><hr>
I feel your frustration. I know people that just say, “Ai don’t worry about that it’s just the way nature works”. Even though the climate disasters we are facing are far from traditional and are leaving people who deal with them baffled. For example, the documentary about the Paradise Fire that we watched, the firefighters could now understand how the fires grew to be such an immense catastrophe because it was not to the level they were used to. I also agree about how fake news has spread to discredit climate scientists or to distribute false information. One of the biggest contributors to that is all the major fossil fuel companies. The fossil fuel companies are the ones that are filling the pockets of the politicians that are making our laws currently. The lecture explained how a majority of the congress members are around 60 years old. They are just taking any money they can get at this point because they will never see the full effect of their actions in their lifetime. The current laws and actions being taken against the environment are not representing the future generation. It is up to our generation and I believe one of the hardest things for us to change our lifestyle. As Ken said, we need to fundamentally reinvest western culture and get rid of that mindset that makes people think that just buying more things will equal happiness. We are being left to clean up what we can of the mess but our future generations will be the ones suffering the most.

As the professor said in the previous lecture, many younger generations are taking their actions to deal with the climate crisis even though they are not the one that caused this to happen. At the same time, there are still large amount of people from older generations refused to take action and ignored the consequences of their actions. Why they are refusing the facts that have been proofed by countless researches and statistic data conducted by scientists? Why there is a huge difference between generations? I believe there are two explanations.
<br><br>

First, older generations were born under a different environment, or a time when climate crisis was not a problem. People at that time were tend to focus on different problems. Unlike the younger generations that have been taught by the teachers about the relationship between climate crisis and its effects on our daily lives, many of them didn’t learn that when they were young. Thus, it is hard for them to believe an issue that once was not a problem now became a crucial crisis for all humanity. 
<br><br>

Second, older people are harder to adapt with time. There is still a large amount of population age between sixty to seventy in the world that don’t know how to use internet or smartphones. Similarly, older people may tend to not believe in climate crisis simply because they refuse to change their life style and adapt.

There is definitely a huge difference between the generations. The younger generations are the one receiving all the bad impacts caused on climate crisis due to the activities  done by the previous generations, But the younger generations are the one actually start to take action and recognize the crisis. What about the older people?Why they can’t do something to help their next generation to provide them a place that is sustainable, healthy and safe to live with? Although I understand maybe they were not taught about the climate crisis at their time and throughout a huge part of their lives they don’t see a huge impact caused by climate change. But it is different now as there are more access to information and they should start to learn more about the climate issue that is occuring now. If they are willing to take a step to take action, there will be more people willing to follow and start to make a change in this planet. The problem of the climate changes might not have shown its worst part now, but what after 10 years later?30 years later or 50 years later? What would the planet be like? Can human in every part of the world still safely live here?

Although the population increases each year, by no means can this increase be caused by the number of inhabitants in the United States. If climate discourse is more prevalent than ever, why is the United States still emitting the most carbon dioxide emissions worldwide? Why are environmental groups and international organizations desperately pushing to bring emissions down, yet making little progress? From my understanding, in recent years, it is the current government that takes most of the blame. A large sum of our economy is based on the extraction of fossil fuels. President Donald Trump is in denial of the climate crisis and has elected a cabinet that largely stands by this belief. Therefore, it is hard to be progressive in diminishing our environmental impact when the government who controls what non-renewable resources are extracted, does nothing but inflate the crisis. It is frustrating to see countless NGOs and other institutions fighting against environmental destruction and little progress being made. It is mostly up to voters and lifestyle changes to protect the danger that our planet is facing now and will be more so in the near future.

I very much agree with you that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions has a huge link to the choice of the government and to ignore environmental issues. Developed countries, especially the United States, have the ability to choose clean energy instead of still choosing fossil fuel in order to achieve economic benefits and basic living conditions of residents. However, Trump still chose fossil fuels, which are extremely harmful to the environment, which is worthy of judgment. But to a certain extent, I also understand the choice of the government. For politicians, the most important thing is interests and benefits. Fossil fuels can bring them economic benefits faster, and environmental problems do not need to be considered when they are in office, because they always think that environmental problems are a slow matter and will not erupt instantly in their generation— —As Ken said in his lecture, they don't care about global warming.

All this talk about which generation is at fault and which generations job it is to fix the crisis I think is really beside the point of this whole issue. Spending time explaining WHY the generation that caused the climate crisis is not acting instead to focusing on HOW anyone in the world no matter what age can act to fix it seems rather ignorant. We shouldn't be here to point fingers at anyone to say that they are at fault and if we do, the four fingers pointed back at ourselves should be to say that we are even more inclined to do something about it if we know so much. It is understood that during the process of the creation of this crisis that people weren't sure of what their actions were actually doing to the world. We get it. But we don't need to hear about the past generations "state of denial...deep, deep denial", we need to hear about ways to change the path of evolution so that this generation does not follow that same state of mind. An apology from the past generation, especially a weak one that includes saying its "a lot to come to grips with" that it was their fault, won't do anything. It's "a lot to come to grips with" that our generation has to live in a deteriorating world that in the bigger picture we were simply just born into (not to say that we aren't adding to the problem too, but we have not been alive long enough to be the core of the problem). Saying that the time to have acted was in the past doesn't necessarily inspire the present and future generations to think that we can turn this all around. I think that information provided about taking action should not include this negative perspective and should be focused on looking ahead in a positive manner.

I agree with you. Blaming each other for this problem only wastes time and creates division between our generations. We are all human and we must work together to fight climate change. I hope our professor talks about ways that we can take action on climate change - there is still time to make a change. I also agree that we must be optimistic about this. We can't change the past but we can still make our world a better place for ourselves and for future generations. Whether we like it or not, our generation must be the ones to stop climate change.

This point was not made by Ken but I think it is relevant to the discussion of why the generation that caused climate change is not acting; the escalation of commitment. There is a financial theory called the "sunk cost fallacy" that cripples the individual from backing out of their decision making process because they have invested too much financially. In this case, individuals of the older generation are suffering due to a long-term psychological commitment of active disbelief. These individuals did not experience any forms of climate change for a vast majority of their lives so they are farther removed from the issue than newer generations. This only reinforces their confirmation bias.  The farther away one's belief is from the proposed statement, the less likely they are to believe it. Not only is it frightening to have people like this in power positions, but it is an apparent reality. 
<br><br>

At this point, the reader can agree or disagree with the proposed statement above. 
<br><br>

Do you think identifying the reason for inaction from the older generation will cause them to change their minds or will it fall upon the newer generation to rally together to use their political capital (in masses) to force policy change?
<br><br>


Do you think it is worth it to continuously villainize the older generation or is there another solution?

I quite agree with the set of points you stated in your comment, especially when you mentioned that “do you think it is worth it to continuously villanize the older generation”. When I browsed some other audiences’ comments, I found some problems about it. In the realm of history, a big taboo is to use today's values to judge the thoughts and ideas of people in the past. Why does our generation treat climate crisis as a priority than older people do? Because climate crisis is now a huge problem in today’s life so that we have to face it and solve it to survive. However, other issues, like social security, were more influential in the past few generations. People had to treat those issues as a priority, just like what we are doing with climate change. There are indeed some egoistical people who are still trying to deny climate change. We should not blame the older generation too much, and I believe most of them just did what had to be done in that era. Without their generation, global warming might be alleviated, but there must be other problems that will cause us to burn out. So, are the older generation all bad guys? Of course not. Some of them just did not catch up on the new issue in today’s life. What we need to do is to try to communicate with them and exchange ideas between the two sides. Just as mentioned in the videos, intergenerational learning is a good idea.
 <br><br>

Now, the climate crisis has been one of the most serious problems in the world. The burden of responsibility has gradually fallen on our generation. We have no time to hesitate and must take action immediately. I believe that Ken will give us more concrete solutions and instructions in the future lectures.


<br><Hr>
I think the "sunk cost fallacy" describes the situation perfectly. "The sunk cost fallacy" is often seen in gamblers who lose money and then continue to go in debt in order to make their money back. That is exactly what the generation before us did, although they may not have known it at the time they took a gamble that the benefits of using fossil fuels to advance society would out way the costs of the environmental impact that has resulted due to the use of fossil fuels. Sadly, as we advanced into the 2000s people began to realize that this was just not the case. Now that the generation who emitted the most carbon into the atmosphere happens to be the most detached from the subject and ever more so they are less likely to change the beliefs that they have held over decades. I think the "sunk cost fallacy" that you mentioned also relates to the idea that we can combat climate change with technology. While this may not be the case for all technology development, some of it will require the use of fossil fuels for transportation and development which further sinks us into a "carbon debt" when we think we are actively trying to solve the problem. 
 <br><br>
As for the two questions you posed in your comment I think the best way to inform older generations is not to vilify them because it is much harder to convince someone something if they feel disrespected by you. I think the best way to bridge the generational gap would be to explain the science of climate change in a simple style in order to educate the older generations.
<br><Hr>
 here are my answers: <br><br>

First, I agree with your statement. You're smart. The older generations are responsible for the majority of the financial investments needed for our lives the way that we live them today, and they’re definitely crippled from backing out of their decisions. This generation that holds most of the power positions in todays world, Ken’s generation, has only recently admitted that they believe in climate change. However, now they are making it clear that they simply don’t care, an attitude even more dooming than denial. Our generation of youth and students has a while to go before we have any legitimate power in the political or economic realm. That fact paired with the terrifying statistics of how quickly emissions and CO2 levels are escalating is harrowing to the point of defeat. As Ken says in the other lecture video, it is up to our generation to rally together and enact change… but realistically, how plausible is that? Fossil fuel companies and other large corporations have been evading democracy for many decades (they saw enough disasters to know their work is harmful but still prioritize the dollar), and fighting wealthy corruption for environmental justice seems like an unwinnable war. The government takes too long to do anything (Trump is still president…?) for any radical change to take place. Blaming the generation who created this issue solves nothing, and waiting for the generation who wants to fix it to be able to is not an option either. The system makes this an impossible feat with no possible path for a solution. 
  <br><br>

Ken says he is suggesting a radical solution for the crisis: student activism. Does this mean more talking to politicians and persuasive writing and sustainable efforts and strikes? What will that do? We need new laws (which won’t happen quickly enough), not to spend heaps of money on a new infrastructure for a solution. We need to pause: turn off the lights, stop consumption, and “reinvent western culture”. We are spending all of our money in college right now in order to pursue our dreams of one day gaining the power we need to enact change, and by then it will be too late. The generation in power has made life unaffordable and work difficult to find. The only way for the rate of disaster to decrease is if we first decrease the excess in our lifestyles. America shows no interest in slowing its capitalistic tendencies, and companies are going to keep manufacturing all that they can for the sake of profit. The drastic change we need in our economy and government is impossible to implement, and we are being thrown into a hopeless battle where ultimately everyone will end up being a suffering refugee.



<br><Hr>
I don’t think villainizing the older generations will amount to anything positive, rather I think it will cause more harm. What’s done is done; it is no longer the time to pass blame as doing so only widens the generational gap and hinders progressive cooperation. The fact that the older generations caused this crisis is not nearly as important as the fact that nearly all of us are perpetuating it. We are all a part of this issue here and now. 
  <br><br>

This being said, the general trend seems to illuminate a major discrepancy: the younger generations recognize the crisis as a priority and are taking action while the older generations are not. In the video, Ken lectures on a recent poll that explicitly describes this. Unfortunately, since the older generations do not recognize the climate emergency as a priority and have largely adopted inaction, it is unlikely they will change now. As you mentioned, the sunk-cost fallacy predicts that no matter the quality or quantity of factual information available, many will continue on in a state of denial.
  <br><br>

This raises the question, if they won’t change, then what can we do? If they hold positions of power, then how do we harness it ourselves? Is our only option waiting until the older generations, as well as their ideologies, die out? Will it be too late by then?
  <br><br>

Additionally, not all younger people view the climate crisis as a priority either; even during our class polls, there is a range of values among us. Many of us live stable, comfortable lives, and have greatly benefited from the fossil-fuel-dependent society our parents’ generation built. While we didn’t have much of a choice in the past, as Ken states, it does present us with a choice for our future. We can use the platform we were given to take action and change, or we can recognize the benefits and pursue them by whatever means necessary. There will be people on both sides, as well as in between, though I think this means even after the older generation is gone, we may still be fighting their lasting ideologies.

<p>
Whenever Ken talks about the preceding generations that have caused the climate crisis, especially his generation that has emitted around 3 quarters of carbon dioxide on this planet, I embarrassingly, but admittedly, roll my eyes. And just to be clear, I do not do this out of hurtful, violent, or distasteful intent. However, I feel like this information is continuously regurgitated because of the guilt that not only Ken, but people from his generation feel about the status in which they have left our planet. In short, Ken essentially states that his generation has delivered the climate crisis to proceeding generations on a silver platter.
  <br><br>


Mind you, I had this attitude before watching this video, and I was hard-knocked on maintaining this mindsite at the end of it. Yet, this video gave me a different perspective in the guilt that Ken faces. Although some of the information is general knowledge, I do believe the statements that Ken make bring us into greater detail on why he feels guilty. To me, it feels as if Ken feels guilty for his entire generation because not many from his lifetime feel the same way that he does. At some level, I feel as if he is overcompensating for his generation. And, in all honesty, it does not beat the scenario in which his generation prevented the climate crisis, but I will more than gladly take it. I take it because many of the people in his generation do not actively fight the climate crisis like Ken does. Ken is absolutely correct when he goes over the demographics of Americans that either do not believe in climate change, or do not see climate change as a pressing issue. And because it was not apparent in their lifetime, it is less important to that of baby boomers and Gen X. However, we are now in the age of millennials and Gen Z - the lifetime in which the climate change consequences can be felt at full effect. However, we are still too young to create policy change, and I will tell you why I am pessimistic about this point.

  <br><br>

To begin, I do believe that millennials and Gen Z have made great strides in activism, not only for the climate crisis but for several social movements that have made its way across America. One example that I can think of that is not related to the climate crisis is the case of David Hogg, a survivor of Stoneman Douglas High School Shooting and an activist against gun violence within the United States. He, along with some of his classmates, took their plea for help and their screams of movement to a national level, making television appearances, hosting large-scale events, and even having the ability to discuss the preventive measures that the NRA is taking to limit American gun violence with a representative from the NRA. So, when it comes to my lifetime, I think that activists - especially young ones - have made their case that they can, indeed, move mountains. 

  <br><br>

That is not my issue. I do not question their ability. What I DO put into question is the ears of legislators, policymakers, and fortune 500 companies that need to hear this, but turn the other way. Ken discussed this, and I would like to point on this fact for the sake of my argument. Most legislators and CEOs profoundly find themselves part of Gen X or the Baby Boomer generations - populations of people that do not find climate change to be a pressing issue. They see social activism as a wave of change that they are not used to, and therefore, refuse to embrace it. We can see this difference clearly with examples such as AOC, or Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who is the youngest representative in Congress who proposed the Green New Deal. Now, there are many people on a large stage that place significance on issues such as climate change, an example being Bernie Sanders, who is a far-left Democratic Senator and Presidential-candidate for the Democratic Party. However, the majority of baby boomers and gen x will not listen. And I worry that it will take until when my generation holds office in order to create real change.

I appreciate your well thought out and articulated argument. I completely agree. It makes me seriously concerned that those most able to implement change to lessen and hopefully resolve the consequences of the climate crisis, are those who deny it, do not listen, or simply do not care enough. I am glad you brought up David Hogg and his fellow classmates who made tremendous efforts to make their voices heard. People like them, many who do not receive the same recognition or attention, are the people who give me hope. And it is in fact, our generation. I have seen first hand what we can do. We have the passion, drive,  and determination to fix the problems that past generations have let slide. In a perfect world, more people from those generations would join us in our efforts to fix their mistakes. With them or without, I know we can get the job done. We are resilient. I, too, fear that change will only come when we hold power in office. I have fear that when that time comes, years down the road, it will be too late. Yes, we have predictions of the effects the climate crisis will have on our planet, but what about unexpected consequences? How detrimental will these consequences be? Will they pose threats to the point of no return? None of us really know what could happen. And that scares me more than anything else.


<br><hr>
I agree that we most likely will not see institutional change regarding the climate crisis until our generation takes power (or someone like Sanders who believes in climate change is elected). While there are some things that everyone can do to live a more sustainable lifestyle, the real solutions to the climate crisis lie within large scale institutional change. Our political system makes these kinds of changes difficult, and I hope that they can be brought about before it is too late. Young activists have definitely made their voices heard in the past few years, but are current politicians willing to listen?
<br><hr>
I agree with your argument. I feel as though there is a lot of difficulty in working together to solve a problem that is very much apparent and pressing. A consensus needs to be reached that climate change is real and an issue that needs everyone's attention and support in order to effectively save the livelihoods of all living things that inhabit our planet. The planet is dying and there is more than enough evidence of it, but I guess it does make sense that generations older than ours would have greater difficulty in accepting this harsh truth. They have lived for most of their life without it being presented as a problem or even the idea of climate change being formulated. However, this does not mean that they are being reasonably in their judgement today. Life and the planet is continuously changing and evolving, just as human civilization has technologically advanced and ways of life have adapted for the utmost convenience. But, this is what I feel is the aspect of human life that has become the most detrimental, we are too comfortable as a species. We desire convenience, comfort, and security. This makes everything easier and more enjoyable and easygoing. However, I feel that this is a form of cowardice and ignorance that follows human nature. With the great advancements we have made as a society, there are consequences for any action. By not willing to take responsibility of the damage we have caused our planet is very wrong and selfish. Even though the developed world has more recently experienced the tragedies of climate change compared to other parts of the globe, the problem has always existed and grown throughout the years. There needs to be ownership from everyone that inhabits the earth today, as every individual should be helping to fight climate change or taking responsibility for participating in a society that settled with depleting the Earth at the expense of future generations. Whatever the reason may be, everyone needs to be taking action to help the planet, instead of waiting any longer till anyone from our generation begins to hold seats of power because I fear that it may have snowballed into a issue impossible to solve by that time.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with your comment. Although the millennials and gen z are making strides to combat and raise awareness for global climate change, those that hold the power to make policies and really implement the change that the newer generations are fighting for don't believe in the climate crisis or categorize it as a small problem, and therefore not a priority. Maybe it is true. We won't see the change we want until our generation can be in office. It really is unfortunate that there are a vast amount of people a part of the millennials and gen z that are passionate enough and driven enough to make change, only to be let down by the people in office who obviously don't listen to our demands for actions. I wonder, had the boomers and gen x listened to our cries and demands and educated themselves around the time global warming was first brought to the attention of many, would our planet still be in a climate crisis?

Through listening to Ken’s commentary, I agree with most of his views, but disagree with the delivery. I agree that the window of opportunity for successful climate intervention is narrowing and that humans need to rethink and change how our species relate to our planet; however, I don’t find perpetual acknowledgement of how the older generation made severe mistakes, denied the problem, and needed to act sixty years ago productive. I appreciate Ken (somewhat) taking responsibility for his generation, ownership of one’s mistakes is key to changing, but time cannot be reversed, so why keep mentioning that the time to act was six decades ago? My first inclination to reason the above question is that Ken is attempting to prescribe a sense of urgency for the issue now, yet dwelling on past mistakes doesn’t push us forward – the direction we need to go. Since the key problems in the climate crisis have been addressed, I would prefer to focus on solutions because that is more productive use of our time.
 <br><br>
Despite my apprehension with his delivery, I find it interesting and unsurprising how much politics influence the climate crisis. As he mentions, 70% of voters believe climate is changing because of human action and the Paris Accord was supposed to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions, which would slow down the heating of the earth. With little enforcement, carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise, which makes me question how do we get all countries, especially those who emit the most carbon dioxide, on board to decrease emissions? The potential of the planet to not be able to sustain life does not seem to be a convincing incentive, so what would be?

While I do agree that we need to spend less time dwelling on the mistakes of the past and instead jump to action in the present moment, I don't necessarily think that Ken's repeated acknowledgement of his generation's shortcomings is unproductive. By exemplifying that the evidence was there, and that the generation had every opportunity to take action and still failed, it can help direct us with how we proceed with our own action. When Ken repeats the mistakes of the last generation, I don't hear it as him dwelling on the past, I hear it as him warning us that we can't rely on the generation in power, and imploring us to act for ourselves. 
  <br><br>
You can't effectively address the solutions until you have a thorough understanding of the root of the problem.
  <br><br>
We've seen that the generation of the last six decades won't act. It's hard to see how we can get them on board, especially after the lack of action despite all the change that we've seen occurring. What we do know is that there is a whole new generation that is angry--very angry--and ready to act. Rather than focusing on the incentives needed to get those in power to act, we need to focus on stepping up and taking charge for ourselves.


<br><hr>

Thank you, I appreciate your different point of view. I now understand a bit more as to why mentioning past mistakes may direct us on how to proceed with our own action, but as another commenter said, this isn't new information. The past generation has largely been inactive against the fight for climate change, so they haven't given us much direction. I agree that our generation is ready to act, yet we are not actually acting. How do we move from being ready to act to acting? I, just as I'm sure you are, am ready to act, but I, admittedly, have not stepped up. With the dependence on those in power and little direction from the past generation, how do we get a majority of (young) people in power and how would they act to slow down climate change? You made a few great points, and this is a complex issue without simple answers.

I felt like this lecture video was good at communicating the idea that the older generations are not going to drastically their lifestyle but that they are going to fight against the change. I think that this lecture is setting the youth up for empowerment. As Ken states that many people are disbelievers in climate change because they say the science was flawed, this type of climate alteration has occurred before, and that bad weather just happens. But the science is not wrong as the earth’s temperature has increased by 1.8F in the last six decades and it is now up to over 2.7F.
  <br><br>

My general reaction is that someone needs to step up and help make the change. I like that Ken stated that the people who need us to rethink our plan of action are people in third world countries, non-humans, and the younger generation because we are all the one who will be affected the most. I am very scared for the future and I really hope that we can come together.

I agree that this lecture video was good at communicating the idea that this is a generational issue and that prior generations are less inclined to change or even view climate change as a problem or a priority. This lecture also definitely made me feel empowered and as if we had a chance to do something for our planet. However, at the same time I definitely feel a lot of pressure on our generation, but at this point we simply can not just ignore the situation and follow the footsteps of the generations before us because as Ken stresses, we simply do not have much of a choice or the time, the climate crisis is here and it's moving fast. I also found it really interesting when Ken said that a way we can help is by educating our parents or older generations. I thought it was interesting because usually it's the other way around but I found myself already doing this, especially after taking this class I find myself calling my parents and letting them know what I have learned as well as educating my younger cousins. But I found that my younger cousins are already aware of the situation which I found very interesting that they already understand the severity of what is occurring to the planet.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that the video is suggesting us that we need to build up our own solutions. We as young generations or our offsprings will be affected by the climate crisis the most. We need to use our power to notice the problem and change our lifestyle to a green life. The older generations may not be aware of the problems. However, if people as my age started to get the knowledge, we can tell out parents and educate the young. The deniers may thought the climate crisis is just the natural cycle, but they can't deny the science and facts that surround them all the time. The truths are there all the times. We as young generations should come together to change our future and bring back the green earth.

<br><hr>
I agree with what you and Ken are saying about the fact that third world countries, non-human, and the younger generation need to paying close attention to what we are doing to make a change as we are the ones who will be the most directly affected by the effects of climate change. With that said, I do believe that it is still important for the older generations to help with the movement. My attitude towards the older generations ignorance towards climate change is annoyed. It frustrates me that some people really do not believe that climate change is a real thing and that scientists are just making it all up when there is actual evidence proving it to be true. If people really think that the sea level rising, the air getting warmer, the natural disasters, the plants and animals going extinct are all normal then they clearly have their head in the clouds. Another thing I was thinking while watching this video is that if I were a part of the older generation I would still want to be taking action and fighting against this issue because of younger members of family. Don't these people want their children and grandchildren to get to experience a beautiful life on this planet that is (or once was) filled with plants, animals, grass fields, mountains, and clean air? Just a thought.

<p>
The fact that climate change is such a slow-growing issue can make it even more difficult to deal with. People don't think there is anything wrong. Therefore, people are more easily plagued with denial. This causes unbalanced priorities and a lot of devastation by the time the consequences of the climate crisis catch up with people.

Imagine if we could visualize global warming. What if the air got more and more opaque as the overall climate got warmer? Maybe then we would make changes, as we’d realize that we would otherwise soon lose our vision in the world. We might recognize that we're on the path to literal blindness, and maybe then we would stop being willfully-blind. I say that most of us are willfully-blind instead of ignorant because we are being prompted to take action and we have the materials necessary to participate in the issue, but many of us choose to ignore it.

Having our own sight at risk would allow us to open our eyes to see the urgency of the situation and would further motivate us to push people in control to actually use their power to establish laws and help us save the planet.

I agree with your statement in which having our own sight at risk can make us have a stronger alert in the severity of climate crisis. This can be totally useful, and also be considered as a hands-on experience that every human being is living in a situation that they realize they have to change their bad habits and knowledge they previously don't know.

It has always been a mystery to me that there is a clear following of the complete denial of the climate crisis. Although it is still an incorrect ideology, it is easier to understand the angle of fossil fuel companies, as they have great stake in the issue and would lose much of their profits if they accepted blame or even acknowledged the issue. Further, I can recognize the difficulty of older generations to admit to their ignorance and selfishness that lead to the worsening of the climate situation, as it is often hard to deal with guilt. However, I have no understanding of those who are in such denial as to believe that climate scientists and environmental specialists are simply wrong in all their corroborated and evidence-supported statistics and conclusions. To be that egocentric and selfish to completely dismiss indisputable fact is beyond me. 
  <br><br>

I found it quite interesting, as it was something I hadn’t given much thought to before, how those who control this country are all from the older generations. These generations, although recently acknowledging the climate issue, do not prioritize the health of the planet above other social issues, such as social security. This poses a big problem in resolving the climate crisis, as those in charge and with the power to make the necessary changes for the environment are focused on finding solutions to other problems. It is most astonishing to me, and rather ironic, that these politicians and heads of power give little mind to the worsening climate, an issue that, if not solved, will likely resolve in the destruction of not just the country, but the whole world. Even if the world lived in harmony and no one went hungry and the politicians implemented all of their social fixes perfectly, these things would not matter, as the planet would be dead.

 I agree with you. Deliberately ignoring and choosing not to believe in scientific evidence regarding climate change is honestly infuriating, to say the least. When the most important political leaders in the U.S fail to comprehend what is going on on planet Earth, my pessimistic side tells me we are doomed. What can we really do to convince the older generations climate crisis will dramatically change the face of the Earth within decades.

<br><hr>
you make some very good points such as that those in power are part of an older generation and are additionally the ones who are in denial of the climate crisis. Yes, these individuals do not prioritize the health of the planet above other social issues, such as social security. In contrast with your opinion, I do not believe their stance is due completely to ignorance and selfishness. The men and women who govern the United States are past the age of sixty, so it makes sense that social security, healthcare, and the economy are the leading issues that they are concerned about. These individuals are aging, getting close to retirement, and death. After retirement, they want to live a financially stable life and for that reason, the economy needs to be doing well or they cannot retire in the timeframe they planned. Since these individuals will retire they will be living off their social security for the most part and all want to take their share from there. There are a lot of baby boomers and they need to make sure that they all suck the money out of social security before funds run low. With old age comes health problems so of course, they will rank healthcare as a top issue. What I am trying to say is that they are not ignorant, but nevertheless they are selfish. By the time global warming is at its worst, most if not all of these individuals will be dead so the issue of the climate crisis does not affect them as it affects us. This is a generational issue because the older someone is the less urgent they find the climate crisis to be. I also disagree with what you said that if politicians implemented social fixes the planet would still die off, this is not true. If anyone has the power to change the climate crisis around it is the federal government.
<br><hr>
While I acknowledge your point about how there is a small contingent of people who "believe that climate scientists and environmental specialists are simply wrong in all their corroborated and evidence-supported statistics and conclusions," I think it is unfair to lump in a larger group of voters with this group simply because they will not yet prioritize climate change over issues such as social security, as you mentioned. I think it is unreasonable to expect people to completely surrender the health of our economy without any certainty that our actions will be met with similar actions by other countries that are needed to change the climate enough to prevent increasing temperatures. 
  <br><br>
While you did not mention any specific policies and I don't want to assume what political plans you would support, for the purpose of my broader rebuttal to the sentiment of many comments on this page I will use the "Green New Deal" as a general example of what policy climate action activists and many students in this class want to see adopted as law. It is an undeniable truth that broad climate action such as this plan, which is loosely defined and surely unworkable in our current political climate, would have immediate and far-reaching economic effects. Similar to how people have mentioned how the U.S.'s historical reliance on carbon-based fuels has affected many parts of the developing world, significant economic downturn spurred by comprehensive climate policy on the scale proposed by activists would greatly affect parts of the world and reduce the quality of life for people who are helped by the U.S. economy. The climate consciousness of a nation's population is easily related to economic prosperity so destroying the global economy in a drastic action could make future climate action more difficult to gain global support for. While this is not an argument to not take the issue seriously or develop solutions, we need to be understanding of potential consequences of action and the hesitation of people to support such drastic policies.

In Ken’s first lecture on the inaction of older generations, he mentions that in a recent poll conducted by Yale and Geroge Mason, the issue of climate change ranked as the 18th most important to “Baby Boomers,” the generation that has generally been alive for most of the era of major climate destruction. I think that this poll really highlights the indifference that generation shows towards the problem, as that despite the fact they caused many of these impending issues related to climate, they see attempting to fix this urgent and global problem as less important than a host of trendy political issues.

  <br><br>

To me, it seems as though much of the apathy older generations, such as the “Baby Boomers”, show is due not only to the time delay in climate-related issues that Ken mentioned, but also do to the relatively shorter amount of time that people in the older generations will likely be spending on earth. They won’t have to deal with many of the more challenging problems brought about by climate change, such as massive sea level rise and extreme temperature increases, because they simply won't be alive.
  <br><br>


This is why Ken’s second lecture, ‘What a new generation can do to mitigate the climate crisis” really connected with me, as I believe that it is truly up to our “Gen Z” generation to attempt to solve climate change. As the ones who will suffer serious consequences due to our changing climate, we have the most to lose through inaction. The best way for us to act I believe, is to vote for the change and action we wish to see, and as Ken stated “take control of this planet.”

When I heard the statistic that the baby boomer generation ranked the climate crisis as the 18th most important issue of the 29 listed, I honestly wasn't shocked. I saw this as matching all of what we have been talking about of how the majority of baby boomers don't truly care about this issue just because they don't see it as alarming. I agree that I think a part of this has to do with the fact that these older generations don't care because they won't live through the worst consequences that will come very soon. Right now, we are beginning to feel the consequences of the huge amount of fossil fuels that caused the emissions of carbon dioxide to increase in the atmosphere. But, because of the time delay Ken talks about in these lecture videos, most older people don't believe that the digging up these fossil fuels has a connection to the climate crisis. 
  <br><br>


Another issue with this that Ken mentioned is the fact that the majority of those in the federal government (from representatives in the House, senators, governors, and even the president) are older than 60 years old. They use democracy for their own benefit (healthcare and social security) rather than helping the earth with what is truly needed. The same goes for major corporations because again the majority of the big CEOs and people in charge of these corporations are above the age of 60 and only see their desires as important. Their desires center around profit and making as much money as they can so they don't care about how their actions affect the earth. This is why fossil fuel corporations don't care to help the earth and put their priorities ahead of what will benefit all of us. 
  <br><br>


I definitely agree with how important it is to vote, especially when it comes to younger generations. Although the rate of 18-29 year olds who voted in the last midterm election increased greatly (1/3 voted), the amount of those above 65 who voted is 2/3 which is a lot more and means that the desires of people above 65 will be prioritized. We need to get students to go out and vote in great numbers to try and fix this issue as fast as we can because it isn't getting better.

About the issue of Climate crisis, we keep believing or lying to ourselves and our future generations that “there’s still time to fix that”, or “we don’t need to worry about it yet.” But just like the video mentioned, the time to act is NOW. It would be already too late when we are witnessing the direct impact of climate change in our own backyard and try to scramble together to act against it. We need to have a vision and understand the bigger picture for tomorrow for the sake of humanity. I definitely feel encouraged and relieved that there is something this generation of us can do instead of sitting back with our hands tied. Out of all the actions we can take, I definitely resonate with the call for us to vote the most. Like the video mentioned, individual actions do contribute in a scale, but what we need are major policy shifts that can impact our environment to a local to regional level. I am very glad that more and more people of our ages are trying to make a difference by casting their opinions. Individual votes might sound futile as people may think “my vote won’t make a difference”, but the power of voting comes when all of us are voting for a better tomorrow. I once had a conversation with my friend from Japan, who talked about how tiny the percentage of teenagers and young adults go out and cast their vote, which results in the government being indirectly in control of the elders, who would only make policies favoring them, and in the end those who refused to go out and vote were the ones who suffered. Therefore, I cannot emphasize enough the importance for us to go out and make a difference in our government and policies that would shape the fate of the planet.

I agree with your comment, the time to act is now. Ken mentioned in his video that most of our government offices are currently held by individuals 60 years and older, so voting at a local and federal level will be crucial in combating climate change. Unfortunately our country has thrived in an economy that has exacerbated the degradation of our environment, and because of that, it'll be hard to remove these people from their thriving positions. In order to fight your enemy, you have to understand your enemy, walk in their shoes and truly understand their position. Let's use Boomers as an example; they have worked their whole lives and now for the most part have good jobs and lives, and want to continue living their good lives for as long as they have, which is not much compared to the current generation. That being said, these people are comfortable where they are, they know that climate change won't impact them like it'll impact us, so they continue behaving in an unsustainable way. A 70 year old CEO that makes 8 figures a year is going to change the way he lives and conducts his company in order to change the world of which he no longer will be part of? Yeah, most wouldn't unfortunately. Voting for people that have OUR best interest and that of the planets is of utmost importance. And I'm not saying that all boomers are complacent, infact there are many individuals from the boomer generation that are acting alongside our generation. Aside from Ken, our presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has been fighting his generation for his whole life, on healthcare, education, AND climate change. Sen. Sanders has proposed a 14 page deal - The Green New Deal that is a step in the right direction for this country and the planet. And anyone who thinks otherwise is plainly idiotic and ignorant. ACT NOW! VOTE!

The developed countries have a fossil -fuel-based economy. They use fossil fuels and they have control over fossil fuels. The fossil fuels bring enormous economic benefits for developed countries and it is inseparable to any country in this world. The leaders of the current society were born in the last century. During their time growing up, they had experienced the change of the world based on this kind of fossil-fuel-based economy. For those leaders, benefits overcome the climate crisis. President Trump was and is a businessman that profits and benefits seem more important; thus he withdrawals from the Paris Agreement. President Trump seems to care more about the economy over the climate.
  <br><br>


President Trump is an epitome of people of his time; as Professor Ken addressed in the video, those people choose to ignore the climate crisis and maintain the way they are. And some people actually did not see this problem. In most developed countries, people have really comfortable lives. They can get well-paid jobs and sustain themselves or their families. They have a very comfortable life: they have cars for transportations, houses to live, free education for their children; but their views are limited. Most of those people never care about social issues or even thinking about changing the climate crisis. It seems distant from their lives. There should be more promotions to the older generations on changing the climate.
  <br><br>


Now the young generations have more access to the internet, and it is easy for them to see more of those climate crises. Professor Ken's Youtube video is an excellent example on promoting climate crisis issues that everyone can easily access. People need to hear from others in order to gain attention. One benefit of the internet is that it can be a medium on promoting how to solve climate issues.

I found it interesting that you described Trump as the epitome of the people of his time. I believe that Trump’s view, that profits and economic “benefits” far outweigh the impacts of climate change, was of the reasons he gained popularity with the older generation. Trump was able to resonate with and gain the support of older generations that benefited immensely from a fossil fuel-based economy. I was amazed to learn that in the 2016 presidential election, only one-third of registered voters aged 18-29 voted, while two-thirds of registered voters over the age of 65 voted. After I learned that so few young people vote, it was no surprise to me that the majority of people who hold power in our government are primarily from the previous generation and are an average age of roughly sixty years old. To take political power of the planet, it is imperative for younger generations to vote. 
<br><br>

I find it angering to know that our generation is faced with the task of solving climate change, though we have contributed little to the climate crisis. Three-quarters of the carbon dioxide that contributed to the climate crisis was emitted into the atmosphere by the past generation. However, many members of the past generation have done very little to combat the climate crisis as a result of both climate denial and climate delay. We must educate people of older generations about the climate crisis and encourage them to take action.

Everyone likes to point fingers at anyone but themselves. Ken’s generation is in denial of the fact that they did something so extremely devasting. Of course, they did not have the intention of this but pretending to not see the problems they cause is ignorance. Ken talks about the different options to combat climate change, acting slowly or not. And he is right, the time is now. Climate denial is not just hurting the future generation, climate denial is not giving the poorer countries a fighting chance, climate denial is taking the lives of innocent animals who cannot help themselves. This issue is bigger than people’s fancy carbon-emitting cars, its bigger than their small individual lives, climate change is affecting every living creature on this planet. And the fact that people are in climate denial for their own selfish reasoning is astonishing. It’s sad to think the poorest people in the world who are the ones fighting for climate change, the ones who are emitting the smallest amount of fossil fuels, are going to be the first to suffer. While yes the new generation is fighting for this change, unless we can get Kens generating to realize and change their actions, it seems that we are unlikely to make any big changing moves.

I think you brought up a really good point about older generations being in denial of the damage they have done to the world. It adds fuel as to how people view the climate crisis. By denying the fact that human actions contribute to the climate changing, it draws attention away from what’s actually happening to the lives that are not in the developed world. Those who face the repercussions of climate change are not only fighting for their lives, but they are also fighting against those in the developed world who are only fighting for their selfish gain. 
<br><br>
I do think apart of the reason why they’re not acting on the climate crisis is because of the fact that simply can’t grasp onto the fact that they are solely responsible for obliterating the environment. However, I think there is more to it. 
<br><br>
They are not acting on the climate crisis simply because they don’t necessarily gain anything from it. Considering how they have already lived most of their life, they are less likely to worry about the climate crisis. This ties into the fact that those in power will do anything to alter public opinions in a way that only benefits their ideas. Those in power are only willing to make change if it benefits them monetarily. They won’t do anything if it comes at a cost. Change is expected when it doesn’t get in their way of their gains. 
<br><br>


Their actions totally contradicts what they have been preaching about preserving the world for our generation and for generations to come.
<br><hr>

I agree with you completely in the fact that it can’t just be this generation fighting to fix the damage created by Ken’s generation, it is also up to the generation that caused havoc to the Earth. Especially since the older generation has a much larger influence on what happens in the world of politics: since the older generation has a larger amount of voters and people of that age are in office. Politics can influence deals that can be created to limit fossil fuel use and start building a better tomorrow. The people who are contributing most to climate change as you stated, are suffering the least amount of consequences. As humans, we are naturally selfish and we try to extract any opportunity possible even if it comes at the cost of others well beings. Poor countries are suffering the major climate change and cannot afford to save themselves from this detrimental effect. Animals are innocent creatures who used to happily roam the Earth and now are awestruck and confused about the new living habits that they are forced to adapt to. Denial is what is stopping change. If people can't admit their faults, how can they start changing? The proof is in the pudding, in 2018 the temperature increased by an average of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit which is twice more than was predicted by the Paris accord. Ken’s generation is the start of the fault of the damage; however, we can educate the past generations into helping change come about. It is difficult to change the minds of stubborn people who believe they did nothing wrong, but it is not impossible.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment, given that climate denial is most common in the developed world and among older generations. I had to take a step back while watching this lecture and realize that as much we try to bring awareness and raise consciousness, there is no point in doing so if no action is being taken. Ken explains that 70% of registered voters in the United States believe that human action is changing the climate. But what are we doing to change this rather than simply knowing it is happening? Yes, although we need to start somewhere and a good place to do so is by bringing more attention to the issue, the longer we wait the more devastating the consequences will be for generations to come . This is why we do not have time to debate this issue and come to an agreement on how to combat it. Each individual has to start doing anything and everything they can to reduce the amount of CO2 they release into the atmosphere, even if it is a small change in our daily lives. 
<br><br>


I like how you explain the size and degree of this issue, as you state "...it's bigger than their small individual lives, climate change is affecting every living creature on this planet". Ken presents us with statistics on a poll that asked different generations to rank issues on level of importance, and I was surprised with the responses. I knew that older generations would not rank this issue as an important one, but I was not expecting it to be of such low importance. As Ken explained, this is a generational issue, meaning that the older you are, the less urgent you will consider the climate crisis. 

<br><br>

I too find it astonishing that older generations are being selfish and not caring about their actions. It angers me that there are young children and animals that are suffering the consequences of this older generation, but those people do not care because they will not have to live with what they are doing. It also angers me that older folks are prioritizing issues like social security and healthcare because their selfishness and arrogance is coming at the expense of poor countries and defenseless wildlife, those who have no responsibility for what the world has become.

I think that Ken's notion that younger generations need to act by taking control of the situation is absolutely true. As Ken said, many people in positions of power are well over the age of 50. As a result, they tend to write and vote for policies and legislature that is in line with ideals that they were raised with. These ideals, however, are not necessarily right, or even moral. One comparison that comes to mind is that of same-sex marriage. Up until 2015, there were no federal laws that allowed the legal marriage of same-sex couples. When the case that ultimately legalized same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court wrote in his dissenting opinion that marriage is defined as "the legal union of a man and woman for life which served the purposes of preventing the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes."  These are the words of the most powerful Justice of the most powerful court in the United States claiming that two people of the same sex should not be allowed to get married because they might be "promiscuous." If such an outdated opinion could be used to possibly define federal legislature on an issue that doesn't affect anyone except the people getting married, then we should definitely be concerned and want to take control of positions of power that can be used to influence policy that can have deadly affects because incumbents refuse to believe science and acknowledge climate change.

Your comparison to same-sex-marriage is a very interesting point. It really shows that the people in power in our government have such old and outdated values that just don’t work in today’s society. Yes, there are many people who still don’t believe in same-sex marriage or climate change, but the majority of people with modern values do. Almost all of the politicians running for office in the U.S are over the age of 50, and I just don’t think that makes sense. Yes, older people have more experience in the world, but it is also difficult for them to understand the issues that my own generation has grown up with. An example of this is how my Grandmother grew up during WW2 in Holland, and she only had one pair of shoes for 5 years. Now she is extremely careful with all of her belongings and her money. Living through the war molded her as a person, just like all of the people in the generation above me were molded by the time they lived through. I think we need to elect people who really understand the issues that my generation is going to have to deal with. It doesn’t even have to be somebody young, just someone who cares and understands.

These two lectures talk deeper and further than the ones last week, by introducing the denial of people in the last generation and an admittedly radical solution for the younger generation to avert the crisis. 
<br><br>
In the first lecture, Ken states the problem of denial is most common among the developed world, which to some degree the same as climate delay. They all can result in the inaction and nonchalant to the climate crisis. Besides, there are three groups of people, or just to say three groups, that will be most affected, the poor people in developing countries, the non-human life, and the children. Considering the problem, it is still a generational issue, which, according to the poll mentioned in the video, “the older you are, the less urgent you will likely find the climate crisis.” Thus, though we young generation cannot gain power and control in this period of time, we should not let the past generation to simply ignore the fact. And in the 2nd lecture, Ken addresses the solution for us to take action. 
<br><br>
Regarding the solution, it is hard not to be radical, because the circumstance is too severe to wait for us and take a cautious plan. “I am simply suggesting that that control needs to be transferred to a generation that grasps the enormity of this crisis – and will thus hopefully be better stewards of this planet.” This sentence clearly explains what we should do. And among a number of methods, the quickest and most effective way is through voting. By gradually increasing the number of younger voters, we will listen to more brilliant thoughts for saving our planet and revolting the current states of “environmental denial”. At last, what I really like is the expression of “creating a new world”. We should not think about just do some minor repairs to the shaking structures. Rather, the world is waiting for us to have a thorough change to save it!

Yup yup yup. Certainly it is the older generation that has ultimately caused the climate crisis and continues to deny its impending reality. Like you mentioned, it is in fact a generational issue. As people get older, the more likely they find the crisis less urgent. This is a tough because they have most of the control with regards to regulation of big companies and government policies that have profound affects on the planet's climate. I find Ken's statement on how the younger generations need to act by taking control of the situation is spot on. 

<br><br>
While it's intimidating with a lot on the line, I find this call-to-action rather exciting. There is no question that our generation was raised with different ideals and outlooks on life than that of our parents. Being able to take control of the world and make changes according to what we know to be true (aka climate change), I'm hopeful that positive changes will be made. To touch on your point and the point Ken made in the lecture, voting certainly is the most efficient way for our generation to take some degree of control while we are still rather young. . Like you said, the world is waiting for us to come save it!
<br><hr>
I agree that the older generation has contributed to most of the greenhouse gases emitted but I also feel that the newest generation must take a bit of the blame too because Ken's last week videos show that this has continued and we are following in the footsteps of our previous generations. I find it very ironic how the older generation rates climate change very lowly in terms of current issues but had contributed a lot to its worsening. I agree that since we have waited so long and let the climate change worsen, we must now seek immediate action and that has fallen to the younger generation since many of the older generation chooses to ignore the issue. It Is also sad to say that climate change is mostly affecting people who contributed little to greenhouse gas emissions. That being developing countries. Lastly, I agree with voting helping in preventing climate change because the video states that much of the older generation is voting and not enough of the younger generation is and this is why people who also do not see climate change as a big issue are being elected. When the last election happened, I asked a lot of my friends if they have voted and many of them said that they did not because one vote was not going to make a difference. They fail to understand that if everyone with this mindset were to vote than their votes would make a big difference. I feel like now the younger generation has more reason than ever to vote because we are becoming more aware of current issues and understanding how some are more severe than others.

I think this video is spot on. The generation that has caused climate change is in extreme denial. They don't want to believe that they could be responsible with such a horrible situation. Most of them would rather just deny and avoid rather than actually come to acceptance that they messed up in the past and need to correct their mistakes. Most people would rather live in willful ignorance and do mental gymnastics to justify their past actions, than just accept that the climate crisis is real. This did a great job of explaining this concept and addressing its errors. 
<br><br>


Ken’s commentary about how the people that should be most upset are 1. Poor people 2. Animals 3. Kids/Our generation. This is an extremely true fact, however, the unfortunate thing is that these three groups have had NO voice in the past. Poor people in countries such as india and africa have too many other problems to deal with, and don't have the voice to implement change. Animals can't talk. Kids haven't been able to get a voice, but they ARE now. Now is the time for us to stand up for the others that can't or don't have the ability to do so.

The divide between the developed world causing more than the majority of the climate change issues and the poorer parts of the world having to be the one to deal with the consequences greatly bothers me. Additionally, I greatly agree that the time delay that works with climate change is greatly responsible for the denial of many of the older generations. I also agree with Zachary that the generation responsible for the great increase over the past decade does not want to accept the facts behind climate change for many reasons. For one, I am sure that it is difficult for them to accept the horrible strain and negative effects they have put on the planet, but I believe that additional factors also greatly contribute to their denial. Like Zachary said, I agree that a large portion of their denial stems from the objection to change. Those that truly understand the complexity of the issues behind climate change and do choose to ignore it are acting this way to avoid changing their own actions. Decreasing one's carbon footprint in a developed country especially like the United States is not easy, but those that don’t care about the long term effects definitely choose to live in ignorance. Another problem that lies at the forefront of this issue with the previous generation not accepting climate change is the lack of education on the issue. Social media and other forms of advertisement can't truly show the science and corresponding effects. Those that have an interest in the climate change issue seek out ways to gather knowledge like watching films, articles, and other forms of research. Even those that are remotely interested seek knowledge to convince them one way or another. I potentially believe that the older generations are not seeking out knowledge like my generation for example, which leads to ignorance. I think that Zachary has a great point with the lack of representation from the groups that are being most affected by climate change. Animal habitats are being destroyed and more and more species are becoming closer to extinction. Animal activists are doing their best, but more support would be needed to counter the major corporations that are causing this destruction. People in less developed countries are also doing their best, but are not able to compete with the system in the United States due to lack of resources, inability to reach out to our government,  and other factors. With that said, it is truly in my generation's hands to protect those that can't help themselves as well as ourselves from the effects of climate change.

<br><hr>
I think it is true that the generation that did the most damage to Earth is in denial but there are also some people in this generation that are not living a sustainable life. As I previously stated in another video there are people of our generation that will not give up eating meat due to it tasting “good” and being raised that way. I understand that is difficult for some people to transition and change their diets but they are also growing up with similar mindsets as the prior generations. 
<br><br>
Also as mentioned when Ken mentioned that animals are innocent in all this and are not aware of why there are changes in the climate I found it quite sad. Often we are thinking about what will happen to our generation and future generations future on earth  and don’t really take into account what animals are going through. I found that comment by Ken touching.

These lectures delved much deeper into the human aspect of the climate crisis, which after all, is what this class is about. Specifically, Hiltner talked about the attitudes of his generation and previous generations as well as politicians. I found it almost upsetting that he blamed his generation’s inaction on the time delay between the time that pollution is released into the atmosphere to the time it takes for drastic changes to present themselves as a consequence. To me, this is no excuse at all because it’s not like global warming was a completely alien topic for the previous generations. Those generations were and are plenty aware of it, but instead, choose to ignore the role they play in it. You can blame this on denial or the crippling feeling that they feel there is nothing they can do about it in their lifetime, but that doesn’t give them a free pass to continue giving into the consumer culture that they’ve created. Simply put, I believe that they lack the seriousness that this situation warrants. 
 <br><br>
 Hiltner provides us with the simple solution of voting and getting our piers to vote as the most basic yet structurally important act we can do. While I don’t disagree with this, I feel that it ignores the fact that corruption is omnipresent in politics and for many politicians, the desire for money and wealth is much stronger than any guilt they feel for taking part in slowly but surely killing our planet. With most of the people in government and the electorate being citizens from the Gen X generation and older, it’s very difficult to see the government prioritizing environmental policies anytime soon. As of right now, the figures in political power aren’t adequately addressing the climate issue, which is exemplified in the flaws of the Paris Agreement. It’s almost as if they’re only addressing climate issues just to hush our generation from because they know complete ignorance regarding it would result in an outright riot. This attitude within politics is what is truly preventing us from creating meaningful legislation that might actually enforce more sustainable practices and zero-emission lifestyles across the nation. Surely, if the U.S. were to make a move such as this, the rest of the world would follow. Climate change is perhaps the one issue that should be uniting every country together to fight one enemy. This is a new type of war and we can only afford to pick one side to align ourselves with.
